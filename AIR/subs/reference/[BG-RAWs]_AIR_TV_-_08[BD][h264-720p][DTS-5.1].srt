1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,550
How long has it been since you came here?

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,220
I imagine you have gotten used to the shrine.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,530
My robes are splendid, as you can see,

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,700
but in reality, I am as good as imprisoned here.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,900
A winged person is a messenger of the gods.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,810
In times of famine or disease, you are able to
communicate directly with the gods

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,800
through your spiritual powers and prayers.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,780
I assumed that your living conditions
would be better.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,980
Just because I have wings, that does not mean
I am a messenger of the gods.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,720
Where are your wings?

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,520
I am hiding them. Normally,
I look just like a human.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,920
What do you think you are doing?!

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,930
Well, since it was shaped so well...

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,400
Do you touch everything that is well shaped?

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,860
How rude you are!

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,370
What is so funny, Uraha?

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,700
The way you were so embarrassed,
Lady Kanna...

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,610
Whatever. But must you always
approach so stealthily?

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,050
You called Sir Ryuya over again today.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,820
You must have grown quite fond of him.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,780
N-No way!

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,850
I am just trying to teach some manners to this
rude, impolite, despicable and shameless one.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
Truly, there has never been anyone
quite like Sir Ryuya.

Episode 8

38
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,360
Lady Kanna, this is for you.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,470
I found this earlier in a back vault
of the wine cellar.

40
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,770
It is highly unusual to find ice
in the height of the summer.

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,110
I felt that I should inform you,
so I brought this for you.

42
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,550
Oh, that is strange.

43
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,720
That shed is an ice cellar.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,490
It is a serious crime
to enter without permission.

45
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,090
Oh my, my.

46
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,620
Dangerous, dangerous.

47
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,560
I knew you two were in this together...

48
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,500
How cold!

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,130
Sir Ryuya, you should try it too.

50
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,770
Eating offerings to Lady Kannabi
is also a serious crime.

51
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,470
You're eating it yourself
as you speak, aren't you?

52
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,680
The three of us together, eating ice. It is as if...

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,690
...as if we are a desperate family with no
savings, surviving on snow under the eaves.

54
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,090
That is such a pleasant metaphor!

55
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,520
What is a family like?

56
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,590
Yes, well, if I were to describe it...

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,460
Hey, do not come so close. It is too hot!

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,430
Wait, wait. Do not be so sulky. Come closer.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,900
I told you not to come so close!

60
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,100
You do not need to go that far.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,780
Why are you here too?

62
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,180
Uh, I just felt like it.

63
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,810
Both of you! Get away from me!

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,740
Are you teasing me?

65
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,750
Being a family means you can
lean on one another.

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,130
How long has Kanna been living like this?

67
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,760
Since you took your position here,

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,930
her life has become so much brighter.

69
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,170
That isn't what I mean.

70
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,140
How long has she been living in this shrine?

71
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,130
I do not know. I have not been here
quite six months yet.

72
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,550
I've only heard that she has been held captive
like this with no one to talk to

73
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,740
and has been moved around from
place to place since she was a toddler.

74
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,660
Sir Ryuya.

75
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,230
It is time for the changing of the guards.

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh...

77
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,000
Why are you so nervous?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,370
Well, since we came here, I have been uneasy...

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,680
I feel that, if we get too close to Lady Kannabi,
we may receive divine punishment.

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,180
As far as I can see, there is no sign
of such a thing.

81
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,550
I hear that many people loathe and fear
the winged people.

82
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,140
I wish to return to regular duty
as soon as possible.

83
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,090
Is anything wrong, Kanna?

84
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,930
Sir Ryuya, do you have dreams?

85
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,370
Sometimes.

86
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,930
What is it? Did you have a scary dream
and cannot sleep?

87
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,610
It was a dream about long ago.

88
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,170
I, as a small child, am sitting
in the dark, just like now.

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,380
I cannot see anything.

90
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,980
I cannot even tell if my own body exists.

91
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,650
I am so scared and so lonely, yet I cannot cry.

92
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,890
Every day is like that.

93
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,690
I sometimes see a warm light.

94
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,630
It is the figure of a person.

95
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,630
However, if I try to catch up with it,
it disappears.

96
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,160
I see the same dream not just once,
but over and over.

97
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,870
Do you know who it is, Sir Ryuya?

98
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,030
It must be your mother.

99
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,540
I do not remember anything about my mother.

100
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,050
A dream is a memory of scenes from the past.

101
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,510
So, even if you do not remember,
you sometimes see it in your dreams.

102
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,160
That means that my body remembers?

103
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,720
Then, it does not necessarily
mean it is a bad dream.

104
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,610
I want to see her...

105
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,040
I never thought being alone
would be as difficult as this.

106
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,780
It has been decided that Kannabi-no-Mikoto
shall be transferred to the north shrine

107
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,550
in order to say prayers for an abundant harvest.

108
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,290
Silence!

109
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,120
Her departure shall be on
the midsummer Day of the Ox.

110
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,690
Are we to follow Kannabi-no-Mikoto
to her new residence as well?

111
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,660
No. We are to remain and follow the orders
to cultivate the land.

112
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,940
I heard. It happens at
this time of year, every year.

113
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,610
I didn't know until this morning.

114
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,520
I will have to part with you and Uraha soon.

115
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,080
We do not have many more days.

116
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,050
Are you all right with that?

117
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,690
With what?

118
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,620
I am asking if you can accept being
separated from Uraha and me.

119
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,430
I am sure there will be interesting people there.

120
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,800
They won't be Uraha or me.

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Do not be arrogant!

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,490
Do I look so spineless?

123
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,870
I will be fine without you.

124
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,870
I have been living alone like this all along.

125
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,770
Weren't you lonely?
Don't you want to see your mother?

126
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,710
I am saying that there are some things that
will not come true no matter how hard I wish.

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,690
Is your mother dead?

128
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,420
She is not dead.

129
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,200
No, she is not dead.

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,960
I am certain Mother is
thinking of me somewhere...

131
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,210
Uraha, Kanna is...

132
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,510
I am busy!
Uraha, Kanna is...

133
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,410
I am busy!

134
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,050
What are you doing?

135
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,420
Can you not see? I am preparing for a journey!

136
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,160
The only one being transferred is Kanna.
We're supposed to stay here.

137
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,790
That is why I am taking her away before then.

138
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,990
It is so inhumane for Lady Kanna
to keep living like this.

139
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,200
Can I ask why you're
so concerned about Kanna?

140
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,140
I would like to ask the
same question of you, Sir Ryuya.

141
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,220
Hmm... If I have to come up with an answer...

142
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,280
I don't know anyone else who's so fun to tease.

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,410
Yes, that is true, is it not?

144
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,320
Hey, Kanna. Wake up.

145
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,390
Good morning.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,260
Intruder!

147
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,990
Shh! Don't make noise. I have to talk to you.

148
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,090
Don't you want to see your mother?

149
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,140
In my duties, I must never disobey
Kannabi-no-Mikoto's orders.

150
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,750
Therefore, if you order me to find your mother,

151
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,740
I will risk my life to do it.

152
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,390
Will you give me the order as my mistress?

153
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,190
Are you agreeable with that?

154
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,090
It's your choice.

155
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,530
In that case, I order you to
guide me to my mother.

156
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,610
Senior Assistant Lieutenant of the
Outer Palace Guard, Ryuya,

157
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,380
humbly swear to fulfill
Kannabi-no-Mikoto's command.

158
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,020
Lady Kanna!

159
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,090
Hurry!

160
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,990
Sir Ryuya! Can we please take a short break?

161
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,060
It does not seem that they have noticed.

162
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,190
It's only a matter of time.
There's going to be a commotion soon.

163
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,900
It is a bit late to realize this now, but
we have acted very rashly, have we not?

164
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,270
Don't start having second thoughts now.

165
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,140
Look there!

166
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,510
What is happening at the shrine?

167
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,480
I don't know,

168
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,650
but it looks like we should move away
from here as soon as possible.

169
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,990
What is it?

170
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,000
Apparently we're surrounded.

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,460
Kanna, Uraha, run as fast as you can!

172
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,430
Run!

173
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,010
Throw down your sword.

174
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,040
Answer me honestly.

175
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,620
You're from Edo, right?
Why are you pursuing Kannabi-no-Mikoto?

176
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,560
I don't know. We were ordered to.

177
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,060
What were your intentions with
Kannabi-no-Mikoto?

178
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,260
Whose orders are you following?

179
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,290
I don't know! We were just ordered
by our superior!

180
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,130
I see.

181
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,010
Stop it!

182
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,750
You! Did you intend to kill him?

183
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,220
If I don't kill him, he'll kill me.

184
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,740
Shame on you! How despicable!

185
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,160
Do you kill people without any thought?

186
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,360
Lady Kanna...
Do you kill people without any thought?

187
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,760
Lady Kanna...

188
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:28,930
Lady Kanna...
I do not wish to be protected by such a villain!

189
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,360
I do not wish to be protected by such a villain!

190
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,470
I hereby order you.

191
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,470
As long as I am your Mistress,

192
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,040
I will not allow you to kill anyone from now on.

193
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,530
Understood?

194
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,850
Yes. I understand.

195
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,410
But do you really think we'll be able to
make it through without killing anyone?

196
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,020
I trust it will be an easy task for you, Sir Ryuya.

197
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,180
Don't make it sound so easy.

198
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Where did you find a kimono like this?

199
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,940
I borrowed it from a clothesline by the river.

200
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,010
Of course, I left some money.

201
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,010
You look good in it, Kanna.

202
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,080
D-Do you think so?

203
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
You have strange tastes...

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,380
Lady Kanna is so funny!

205
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,520
While she was changing,

206
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,590
she said that she did not wish you to see her
if the kimono was unbecoming on her.

207
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,380
Silly! Do not mention that!

208
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,740
This is not so tasty, is it?

209
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,240
When the three of us eat dried food
like this, it is as if...

210
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,950
As if we're court nobles being demoted
to some back country,

211
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,680
moistening our food with tears of frustration.

212
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,510
Such an elegant metaphor, is it not?!

213
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,720
Those are beanbags. They were in the kimono.

214
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,790
But, beanbags made with cloth inside
are rather unusual.

215
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,800
Normally, they would be made
with stones inside,

216
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,930
but I imagine they were made out of
consideration for the safety of children.

217
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,470
Do you think I can do it, too?

218
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,930
I am sure you will be good at it
with a little practice.

219
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,950
You cannot be expected
to do something well at first.

220
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,150
Patience is important for everything.

221
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,990
M-My hands were not steady, that is all.

222
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,990
You must not be so forceful.

223
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,930
Just at your eye level...

224
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,490
I know!

225
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,230
I never knew she was this clumsy.

226
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,640
Oh, Lady Kanna, poor thing...

227
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,430
Do not be so dramatic!

228
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,750
I heard that your mother is confined
on a sacred mountain in Kishu.

229
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,990
Where is Kishu? Is it far from here?

230
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,960
Yes, it is... especially if we walk
along the mountains.

231
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,220
Let us proceed carefully, without rushing,
so that we will not be caught by the pursuers.

232
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,600
Ouch!

233
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,670
Let me...

234
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,860
It's been a whole month, but you haven't
gotten any better at all.

235
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,230
Sometimes I can do it well.

236
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,130
I did it three times in a row, three days ago.

237
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,560
Oh, that is impressive.

238
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,720
You are insulting me, are you not?

239
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,100
When we sit around a fire
in the mountains like this...

240
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,510
...it's like I'm some lady's man
who kidnapped a princess,

241
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,510
and is regretting it because
he realizes how naive she is.

242
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,080
That is such a free-spirited metaphor, is it not?

243
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,710
It is not really a metaphor. It is almost a reality.

244
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,790
We are practically in Kishu.

245
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,520
We will not have this kind of life
for much longer.

246
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,010
Why are they so joyous?

247
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,110
When they dance like that,
they can forget about their problems.

248
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,150
That is not all.

249
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:50,610
They all believe that their wishes
will reach the heavens.

250
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,480
Who will deliver them to the heavens?

251
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,890
Well...

252
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,260
I have wings, but I cannot fly.

253
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,500
I have tried it many times since I was a little girl.

254
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,700
Flying to the heavens is out of the question,
for I cannot float even to tree branches.

255
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,540
They are useless wings.

256
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,840
Still, I wonder if I pray,
if my wish will reach the heavens.

257
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,610
It will.

258
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,760
It's enough just to hold your wish in your heart.

259
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Your wish is sure to come true.

260
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,590
Isn't that right, Uraha?

261
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,260
It certainly is!

262
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,270
Hey, Uraha, you're tickling me.

263
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,670
Hey!

264
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,820
It is so quiet.

265
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,120
Don't drop your guard.

266
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,490
We should be within the bounds
of the sacred mountain.

267
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,920
It seems that a joining boundary is in place.
Please be quiet.

268
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,030
I feel it is this way.

269
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,000
You sense it?

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,940
Yes, it is just an intuition.

271
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,510
Don't utter a sound.

272
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,720
Warrior Priests, huh?

273
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,890
Women are banned here!

274
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,660
You look like a country soldier.

275
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,420
What business do you have on this
sacred mountain?!

276
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,530
I was wandering through the night merrily.

277
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,300
It seems that I was tricked by a wild fox!

278
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,790
Or was it a wild tanuki?

279
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,510
We cannot let you go.

280
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,340
If you cross the boundary,
we can no longer touch you.

281
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,680
Sir Ryuya, behind you!

282
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,790
I will not allow you to kill anyone from now on.

283
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,640
Sir Ryuya!

284
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,940
Stay away!

285
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,580
You, what are you scheming?

286
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,740
I will not let you see Yaobikuni.

287
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,080
Yaobikuni...

288
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,490
Sir Ryuya!

289
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,660
You came through!

290
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,560
I am so glad! It seems the worst is over!

291
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,470
How long have I been sleeping?

292
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,940
For a full day.

293
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,040
Do not worry!

294
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
We have crossed the joining boundary.

295
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,080
The monks will not be able to reach us.

296
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,540
I see.

297
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,140
I will go fetch some water.

298
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,580
Sir Ryuya.

299
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,790
Are you hurt, Kanna?

300
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,960
I said to you not to kill anyone,

301
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,970
but that was... I realize now, I...

302
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,100
I am loyal to you.

303
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,500
I will follow your orders
no matter what they are.

304
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,570
For example, if you order me not to die,
I will never die.

305
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,220
Then, I will order you.

306
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,620
No, this is not an order. It is my plea.

307
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,930
Sir Ryuya, please do not die.

308
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,360
I won't. I promise.

309
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,030
Is this it?

310
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,170
Yes. I feel something.

311
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,040
Is Mother here?

312
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,710
Most likely.

313
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,470
Out of the way.

314
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,510
Stop.

315
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,280
If you are trying to drag me into a war,
know that you will not leave here alive.

316
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,460
I am Kannabi-no-Mikoto's attendant, Ryuya.

317
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,620
Forgive me, but I assume you are
Kannabi-no-Mikoto's mother.

318
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,000
Kanna!

319
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,660
Are you my mother?

320
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,090
My wings. They cannot flutter or fly.

321
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,720
But, if you have the same wings...

322
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
Kanna!

323
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,160
Mother!

324
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
You there, Ryuya!

325
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,530
Take Kanna off this mountain right away.

326
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,750

What are your intentions with me?

340
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,570
What are your intentions with me?

341
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,840
We will take you away from here.

342
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,640
Then you will live happily ever after
with Lady Kanna.

343
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,850
Mother...

344
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,800
Let us set up a small residence
somewhere quiet.

345
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,250
Dreams are not all sad.

346
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,990
I have enjoyed myself.

347
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,780
Kanna!

348
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,290
Why?

349
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,130
Why does everyone... leave me?

350
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,930

Why does everyone... leave me?

1
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,660
When did you make the hidden door
in the fence?

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,720
I got it ready a while back,
so that we could escape at any time.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,530
You are certainly my guard.
You are quite earnest in your job.

4
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,180
This is no time to be sarcastic!

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,910
I know that.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,040
Until I meet Mother,
I will endure any hardship.

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,320
Starting here, there isn't going to be a path
for a while. Watch your step.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,380
This is no big deal...

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,420
Like I just said...

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,060
Lady Kanna! Are you all right?

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,990
Do I look all right to you?

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,760
I cannot see in the dark.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,330
I hope your clothing did not get soiled...

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,640
My clothing is more important to you than I?!

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,370
Both of you, pull your kimonos up.

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,880
Oh, that is naughty of you
to ask us both at once!

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,280
Yeah, you are no better than a wild beast.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,210
Would you listen to yourselves?

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,620
I'm only suggesting you lift your kimono
to make it easier to walk.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,550
I think our pursuers are near.

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,710
Sir Ryuya.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,830
We watched the vapor trails

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,660
As they disappeared

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,670
We ran from the blinding light

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:42,070
In vexation we let go

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,050
There are still places she cannot reach

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,300
She gazes with wistful eyes

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,640
Children walk along the tracks in summer

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,980
In both hands, their wish to take wing

30
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:20,150
We chased and chased vanishing vapor trails

31
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,030
Since the day we climbed over that hill

32
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,090
Unfailingly

33
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,800
And just like we have always

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,230
Stood straight and tall

35
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:44,380
We will stay as strong as the god of the sea

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,970
Surely

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,650
Don't go far from me.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,570
Run!

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,540
Part 1

40
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,630
You can move now.

41
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,500
What a bother...

42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,110
You did a good job of keeping quiet.

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,040
Do not underestimate me!

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,180
I am not so spineless.

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,450
Hurry up! I will leave you behind.

46
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,640
That's the way we came.

47
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,980
Looks like there's a lot of them out there.

48
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,590
Uraha, you have a change of clothes
for Kanna, right?

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,030
The two of you just sit around here and relax.

50
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,900
Don't move from here.

51
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,140
Sir Ryuya?!
Don't move from here.

52
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,840
Sir Ryuya?!

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:16,940
Sir Ryuya?!
Don't worry.

54
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,700
Don't worry.

55
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,910
Over there! It's a woman!

56
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,400
She is surprisingly fast!

57
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,310
Don't lose her! Hurry!

58
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,800
The woman fell into the river!

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,260
Seems that she fell into the river!

60
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,960
The sound came from directly below here.

61
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,860
Look! Her garment!

62
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,020
Get everyone here! Hurry!

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,270
Downstream! Search downstream!

64
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,310
Throw down your sword.

65
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,120
Answer me honestly.

66
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,020
If you do, I will spare your life.

67
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,330
You're from Edo, right?
Why are you pursuing Kannabi-no-Mikoto?

68
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,560
I don't know. We were ordered to.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,870
What were your intentions with
Kannabi-no-Mikoto?

70
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,970
Whose orders are you following?

71
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,130
I don't know! We were just
ordered by our superior!

72
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,030
I see.

73
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,900
Stop it!

74
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,520
You! Did you intend to kill him?

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,190
If I don't kill him, he'll kill me.

76
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,520
Shame on you! How despicable!

77
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,590
You had just said that you would
spare his life, did you not?

78
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,630
Do you lie with no shame?

79
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,470
Do you break your promises without shame?

80
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,570
Depending on the situation...

81
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,610
Are you telling me that,
depending upon the situation,

82
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,600
you will break your promise to me, as well?

83
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,080
Do you kill people without any thought?

84
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,420
Lady Kanna...

85
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,350
I do not wish to be protected by such a villain!

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,590
I hereby order you.

87
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,990
As long as I am your Mistress,

88
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,530
I will not allow you to kill anyone from now on.

89
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,120
Understood?

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,230
I understand.

91
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,970
As long as you understand...

92
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,750
But do you really think we'll be able to
make it through without killing anyone?

93
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,840
I trust it will be an easy task for you, Sir Ryuya.

94
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,140
Don't make it sound so easy.

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,550
Relax. I don't see any pursuers.

96
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,960
Thank goodness...

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,930
Uraha, sorry to trouble you,
but can you fetch some water for us?

98
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,670
I think there is a stream down below.

99
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,260
Certainly.

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,470
Kanna, are you all right?

101
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,810
Do not speak to me. I have a headache.

102
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,870
It's the heat. Here...

103
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,070
What do you think you are doing?!

104
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,380
Just trying to cool you down.

105
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,120
Say something before
you do something like that.

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,220
Okay, I'm going to pour water on you.

107
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,090
I mean, can you not do it a little more gently?

108
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,060
Don't be such a brat!

109
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,730
Y-you shameless fool!

110
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,730
Oh, my, my, Lady Kanna.
I see you are feeling much better now.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,980
Yeah, children recover quickly.

112
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,170
I am not feeling better! I am angry!

113
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,950
But we have a problem.

114
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,320
Summer is coming and it will get hotter.

115
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,880
If she stays in that garment,
the heat will get to her soon.

116
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,990
Do not worry. I have prepared this for her.

117
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,190
Okay, Lady Kanna. Please come here.

118
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,200
I-I am comfortable like this.

119
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,360
My, my... Just like a spoiled child.

120
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,410
Oh, my, my. You are drenched in sweat!

121
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:20,950
Hey, do not touch my private places...
Oh, my, my. You are drenched in sweat!

122
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,950
Hey, do not touch my private places...

123
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,750
Hey, do not touch my private places...
As I thought! You are wet all the way through!

124
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,280
As I thought! You are wet all the way through!

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,980
S-Stop! You are tickling me!
As I thought! You are wet all the way through!

126
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,820
S-Stop! You are tickling me!

127
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,750
I am telling you to stop it!

128
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,560
What's wrong?!

129
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,660
Lady Kanna's kimono was taken
by that monkey...

130
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,920
Give it back, you insolent beast!

131
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,930
Step back.

132
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,540
Well done, Sir Ryuya!

133
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,600
Indeed, that is as my loyal servant should be.

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,220
Stop, silly, stop!

135
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,020
No, I will not stop.

136
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,790
To jump into your Mistress's dressing room,

137
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,420
that is the most disloyal act of all!

138
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,890
You just said that I was loyal, didn't you?!

139
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,460
Stop the irrational talking back!

140
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,830
Who's being irrational here?!

141
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,430
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,340
Where did you find a kimono like this?

143
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,280
I borrowed it from a clothesline by the river.

144
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Of course, I left some money.

145
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,850
You look good in it, Kanna.

146
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,750
D-do you think so?

147
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,680
You have strange tastes...

148
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,890
No matter how you look at it,
you're a veritable country girl.

149
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,190
You might even be a little too cute.

150
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,950
You are a tiny bit bony, though.

151
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,660
That "bony" remark was unnecessary!

152
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,370
You don't seem to be getting any better.

153
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,050
When learning something new,
the beginning is the most important.

154
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,110
If you have a good foundation,
you will progress in no time.

155
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,590
You are telling me to practice with these?

156
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,580
Beanbags are supposed to be
made with stones.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,830
If I make a mistake and they hit me, it will hurt.

158
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,900
If you sense there is a danger,
then you will try harder.

159
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,870
No, throwing beanbags isn't supposed
to be so dangerous.

160
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,460
Go on now, Lady Kanna!

161
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,600
They're ignoring me...

162
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,180
Lady Kanna!

163
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Hey, are you all right, Kanna?

164
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,280
Lady Kanna!

165
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,630
She's sleeping well.

166
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,600
Being active is the best way to sleep well.

167
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,590
All these years, she was confined in the shrine.

168
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,030
You are right...

169
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,310
You go ahead and sleep too, Uraha.
We'll have to hike mountains again tomorrow.

170
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,310
You must be tired too, are you not, Sir Ryuya?

171
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm all right. I'm used to stuff like this.

172
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,020
You mean battle?

173
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,380
Yeah.

174
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,360
Please rest, if even for a little bit.

175
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,730
I will keep watch over us.

176
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,430
Then, I guess I'll take you up on that.

177
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,770
I have some good ones.

178
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,440
This seems to be a big market.

179
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,250
What is a market?

180
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,050
It is a place where merchandise is traded.

181
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,620
Don't make a lot of noise.
We're being pursued, you know.

182
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,690
I know. I am not that stupid.

183
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,630
Uraha! What are these?

184
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,960
They are called Ubai.
It is a medicine for stomachaches.

185
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,030
Oh, that really, really sour stuff.

186
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,370
Oh, here is some mochi.

187
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:47,900
Once, you tried to eat too many at once
and almost choked on it.

188
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,270
They were so good, I could not resist.

189
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,450
What is this, then?

190
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,890
I think it is sweet rice wine.

191
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,380
Once, you drank too much and
you became violent and...

192
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,730
There is no need to speak about
such unimportant incidents!

193
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,330
Hey, did you forget I just told you
not to make noise?

194
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,900
Do not worry. Any noise will be drowned
in this much commotion.

195
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,180
Who would be able to identify me
in this crowd to begin with?

196
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,610
I am, after all, just a bony country girl.

197
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,920
Holding a stupid grudge...

198
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,190
All right, I was wrong. You're cute, very lovely.

199
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,990
You stand out so much because you are
so lovely, so please be quiet.

200
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,360
As usual, your compliments
do not sound sincere.

201
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,140
You there. What are these striped balls called?

202
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,710
They're melons.

203
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,910
Melons are softer and juicier, are they not?

204
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,350
You cannot bite into it if it is so hard.

205
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,450
You must be high-class. Where are you from?

206
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,950
If you walk for about ten days from here
over the mountains...

207
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,860
Yeah, we have trouble with this girl.
She has a bit of a mental problem.

208
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,920
I'm sorry to hear that.

209
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,700
Who are you saying has a mental problem?

210
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,970
Who else can there be besides you?

211
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,160
Talk to her, Uraha!

212
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,100
Wait, she's gone...

213
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,540
Uraha!

214
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,100
Where are you, Uraha?

215
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,610
Ouch! Don't bite, don't bite!

216
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,740
That is because you are so rough!

217
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,880
I ended up spending half the day
baby-sitting Kanna, after all.

218
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,420
Where did Uraha go?

219
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,260
I have never seen an ugly bird like you before.

220
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,860
No wonder you're still sitting here unsold,
clucking so fussily like that.

221
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,870
Cuckoo birds and buppousou birds
chirp more merrily.

222
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,410
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

223
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,680
You dare to laugh at me even though
you are a mere bird! How insulting!

224
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,090
Those silly tail feathers!

225
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,520
I am going to yank them right out
from your very skin!

226
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,600
P-please stop it. That is my best Onaga!

227
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,770
What are we going to see next?

228
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,910
First we're going to look for Uraha.

229
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,850
Excuse me, sir!

230
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,190
Excuse me, sir. Please have mercy on me.

231
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,230
I was chased out of my village three days ago,
and I fled with nothing other than what I wear.

232
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,130
A war?

233
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,130
I do not know.

234
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,600
A group of ferocious armored warriors
simply ordered me to leave

235
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,740
and took over my home and fields.

236
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,040
Oh, you didn't deserve that.

237
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,640
Oh...

238
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,180
By any chance, is that young lady
there of noble blood?

239
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,310
Oh, you can tell?

240
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,390
Oh, no. You are mistaken completely.

241
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,260
I am only a cute village girl,
with nothing to hide.

242
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,230
Just a little bony, is all.

243
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,160
She's still holding a grudge.

244
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,040
Why are you just standing like that?
Give him something.

245
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
What do I have to give him, though?

246
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,680
This isn't worth much, but it might be useful.

247
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,410
Thank you so much. I will never
forget your kindness.

248
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,510
Take care of yourself.

249
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
We did a good deed, did we not?

250
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,790
Not necessarily.

251
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,090
Why do you say that?

252
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,560
He could be pretending.

253
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,430
If I was starving, I would lie or use flattery.

254
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,840
You're a fool if you believe that kind of story.

255
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,410
You really are dumb.

256
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,400
Nothing changes the fact that
he was extremely thin.

257
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,110
Oh, yeah, I see.

258
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,020
But, I am hungry.

259
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
The second I get impressed with her,
she says something like that...

260
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,150
That is because these are
Lady Kanna's growing years.

261
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,630
If you're growing, instead of padding your butt,

262
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,070
why don't you try putting some on your chest?

263
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,530
Be quiet.

264
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,940
You're quiet, Uraha, what's on your mind?

265
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,910
You are not surprised...

266
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,940
Whoa! Uraha, when did you get back?

267
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,810
I never noticed at all.

268
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,540
You disappear and reappear
like a stealthy ghost.

269
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,380
I do truly appreciate your
sarcastic compliments.

270
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,850
Where have you been?

271
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,160
I will tell you that later.

272
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,130
I almost forgot, I have something for you,
Lady Kanna.

273
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,760
A walnut, huh? That's rare in this season.

274
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,770
It is good luck, as it comes from a branch
at a shrine that got walnuts unusually early.

275
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,200
It is Lady Kanna's favorite,
and it is nutritious, too.

276
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,840
Seriously, though. I had a hard time
while you were gone.

277
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Oh, Lady Kanna!

278
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,250
S-stop!

279
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,880
Uraha, you weren't thinking about dumping
Kanna on me, were you?

280
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,250
Only you would think such
disrespectful thoughts, Sir Ryuya.

281
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,960
Why does it not break for me?!

282
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,140
Stop, stop. You'll break your teeth.

283
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Let me do something to help.

284
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,130
I do not feel good about making
the two of you work all the time.

285
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,880
Then, go collect some firewood.

286
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,910
And leave the walnut here. I'll break it for you.

287
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,120
Thank you.

288
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,060
Now then, I will go collect some firewood.

289
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,490
All right.

290
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,960
Don't go too far!

291
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,720
I will not.

292
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,770
They have set up a checkpoint
past the market we were at earlier.

293
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,240
They were picking out young girls
and checking their backs.

294
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,210
I believe they were checking to see
if any of them had wings.

295
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,440
I guess we'll have to avoid the main
roads from now on.

296
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,940
But how did you notice that?

297
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,650
That is somewhat a strange location
for a market.

298
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,920
I felt suspicious, so just in case...

299
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,180
You sure are wise about the world.
That was a big help.

300
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,530
Where did you learn such a skill?

301
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,970
I just do this for fun.

302
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,570
But I also do it because it's not good
for me to be out of practice.

303
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,210
Don't tell Kanna.

304
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,970
I'm afraid she might say a walnut
is a living being, too.

305
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,310
"I will not allow you to kill anyone
from now on," was it?

306
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,980
Do you think I'll really keep my word?

307
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,590
Kanna ordered me to never say this, but...

308
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,790
Do you remember the night
we left the shrine?

309
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,770
After that, when she heard the
pursuer's whistle, Lady Kanna said...

310
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,710
Sir Ryuya is being pursued.
We must go immediately!

311
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,830
If I do not go, Sir Ryuya will be killed!

312
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,240
If Sir Ryuya dies, then I, I...

313
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,980
I told her that it was a scheme,
but she would not believe me.

314
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,480
I see.

315
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,460
With all due respect, I believe you will
keep your promise not to kill.

316
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,260
Why do you think so?

317
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,030
If Lady Kanna had ordered the pursuer killed,

318
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,300
what would you have done?

319
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,070
I probably would've gotten angry.

320
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,230
I would've said not to take human life lightly.

321
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,610
Adults have to set good examples for children.

322
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,810
I agree completely.

323
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,150
I got them!

324
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,940
Did I do good?

325
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,680
Lady Kanna!

326
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,780
I told you to be careful, didn't I?

327
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,390
Be quiet. I only lost sight of where I was going.

328
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,670
Sir Ryuya...

329
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,480
Sir Ryuya...

330
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,950
Sir Ryuya...

331
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,590
What is it?

332
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,660
I have a favor to ask of you.

333
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,660
I am a little embarrassed, but...
would you look?

334
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,720
Catching hold of the remnant

335
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,020
Of a dream that fades to white

336
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,790
The young boy runs

337
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,040
When he lets go

338
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,270
It vanishes forever with

339
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,050
The cry of the wind

340
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:55,680
A gentleness, once so apparent, is now gone

341
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:06,860
My eyes remain on the steps my feet take

342
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:15,610
Hearing forever the sounds of singing

343
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,250
That had faded away by morning

344
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:37,660
Always following in the footsteps we left behind

345
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,290
Next Episode

346
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,770
Ow!

347
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,810
I don't know my parents' faces.

348
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,680
Why ever not?

349
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,540
I think I was abandoned.

350
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,450
Unsui picked me up when
I was crying on the roadside.

351
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,890
Part 2

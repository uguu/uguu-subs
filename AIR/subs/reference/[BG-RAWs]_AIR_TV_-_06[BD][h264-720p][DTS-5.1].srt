00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,640
Good morning.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,250
What?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,070
Hm?

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,960
Oh, I remember. You've been staying here since last night, haven't you.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,240
Breakfast is ready.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,090
Did you bring all these from the house?

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,190
Yes.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,910
You might be more suited to travel than I am.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,650
Minagi!

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,510
Welcome home!

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,840
Michiru.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,660
I was worried about you since you didn't come yesterday.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm glad I made that wish.

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,830
Wish?

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,050
Yeah, I made a wish on the star sand, that you would come back.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,990
I see.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,350
Okay, let's have breakfast, breakfast!

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,010
Yay! I'm gonna eat, too.
Okay, let's have breakfast, breakfast!

19
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,260
Yay! I'm gonna eat, too.

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,520
Hey, restrain yourself a little.
Yay! I'm gonna eat, too.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,970
Hey, restrain yourself a little.

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,000
What? Don't be so stingy!

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,530
I'm not stingy!
What? Don't be so stingy!

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm not stingy!

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,410
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

26
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,530
Kieru hikoukigumo bokutachi wa miokutta
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

28
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,160
We ran away because it was so bright

We ran away because it was so bright

30

00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:13,940
There are still unreachable places in the distance

Todokanai basho ga mada tooku ni aru
There are still unreachable places in the distance

36
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:21,450
There are still unreachable places in the distance

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:21,920

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,320

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,330
That she gazes at with her wishes tucked away

40
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:28,620
The children walk along the summer railways

Kodomotachi wa natsu no senro aruku
The children walk along the summer railways

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,840
Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,290

Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

44

Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

45
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,580
We've been chasing and chasing after the disappearing vapor trails

kitto

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,180
Why didn't you wait for me this morning?

63
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,150
I came to get you.

64
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,930
Oh, I had something to do.

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,670
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, that's okay.

67
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,990
Are you still having those dreams?

68
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,550
Yeah. Last night's dream was set in a forest at night.

69
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,920
I was talking with someone in the forest.

70
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,250
In a forest? With whom?

71
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,120
I don't know, but there was someone beside me.

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,290
I asked that person what an ocean was.

73
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,750
Then, she told me many things about the ocean.

74
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,410
It was a lot of fun just talking to her.

75
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,770
So much that I wanted to wrap her words up and keep them forever.

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,080
If you had that much fun, then you should keep sleeping forever.

77
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,300
G-Gao...

78
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,230
Ouch!

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,700
episode six

80
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,020
A fan, a fan!

81
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,040
Kunisaki-san.

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,100
Welcome home!

83
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,090
I'm home.

84
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,780
How was your day? Did your puppet shows go well?

85
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,670
Well, uh, no.

86
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,020
What are you doing? You're not good for anything, Kunisaki Yukito!

87
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,450
What did you do that for?

88
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,180
Oh, shut up! Who do you think you are, freeloader?
What did you do that for?

89
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,770
Oh, shut up! Who do you think you are, freeloader?

90
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,030
What?!
Oh, shut up! Who do you think you are, freeloader?

91
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,590
What?!

92
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,560
Why you!
What?!

93
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,220
Playing, eating, sleeping.

94
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,250
It's a truly enviable life.

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,950
I dreamt of my father last night.

96
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,670
Your father?

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,780
A long time ago, we would often watch the night sky here.

98
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,910
My dream was about those days.

99
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:10,120
<i>Minagi, a god lives on each of those stars and protects us,</i>

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,390
<i>and purifies the hearts of those who observe them.</i>

101
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,640
Some time after that, he left home.

102
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,290
After we lost my sister, my parents couldn't get along anymore.

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,290
Where is he now?

104
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,120
I heard that he remarried in a town far away.

105
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,490
He gave me this right before he left.

106
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,410
Hey, don't you have to work?

107
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm taking a break for now.

108
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,320
Hey, Minagi ran away from home, right?

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,300
You can't hide it from me. I'm her best friend, after all.

110
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,760
Things mustn't stay the way they are.

111
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,470
Minagi has to wake up from her dream.

112
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,900
What do you mean by that?

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,930
I'm gonna go ahead and go home.

114
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,090
See you. Piko.

115
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,630
Hey.

116
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,440
See you later!

117
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,450
I am sorry to have bothered you.

118
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,460
Not at all. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to stop by.

119
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,370
All right.

120
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,500
She's started to remember?

121
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,460
She said that she had lost something important.

122
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,160
So that's why she came to visit you.

123
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,220
I just told her that she would remember when she found it.

124
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,750
The rest is up to Minagi-san's feelings.

125
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,560
Welcome home.

126
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,660
Is something wrong?

127
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,030
I've decided to leave this town.

128
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,840
I've stayed too long. It's about time.

129
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,020
I... see...

130
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,090
Why don't you come with me, Tohno?

131
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,880
What?

132
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,560
I want to show you the world -- the real world, not a dream world.

133
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
The world...

134
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,290
Let's go together to discover the world.

135
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,990
I'm ready.

136
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,640
Okay. Here we go.

137
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,410
Umm, Kunisaki-san...

138
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,630
May I say something to Michiru, before we leave town?

139
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,020
Don't worry; just follow me.
May I say something to Michiru, before we leave town?

140
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,910
Don't worry; just follow me.

141
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,560
Okay, we're finally here.

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,480
Why?

143
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,880
Michiru said that she didn't want to see you being sad.

144
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,430
Michiru said that?

145
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,920
You must decide for yourself what you are going to do.

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,370
If you want, you can really come with me.

147
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,620
I'll take you along, wherever it is I end up...

148
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,380
It's your choice.

149
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,330
You, Tohno Minagi, must decide of your own will.

150
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,160
Mother.

151
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,370
Minagi...

152
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,340
Mother!

153
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,440
There are so many stars out again tonight.

154
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,570
Yeah.

155
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,670
I wonder if Minagi is looking at the stars, too.

156
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,940
Yeah, probably with her mom.

157
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,700
I have to go back now.

158
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,230
Yeah, it's getting late. If you want, I'll walk you home.

159
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,810
Where's your house?

160
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,080
I have a place to go back to.

161
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,300
Michiru?

162
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,890
There is a very lonely girl in the sky.

163
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,170
A girl? In the sky?

164
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,210
That girl only has sad dreams, and has nothing else to look forward to.

165
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,140
Since she can't be happy, she can't help but have sad dreams.

166
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,500
She has battered wings on her back.

167
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,900
Those wings have a very mysterious power.

168
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,700
They are packed with many memories of many people.

169
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:19,450
She granted me one of those plumes, because there was someone I wanted to find and comfort.

170
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,910
And I thought if she became happy,

171
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,420
then the girl in the sky would become happy too.

172
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,440
I see.

173
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,820
People can't live without memories.

174
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,440
But, you know, you can't live with only memories either.

175
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,280
You have to wake up from dreams sometime.

176
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,690
A dream that you don't wake from will eventually bring sadness.

177
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,900
So, I'm gonna go return the plume.

178
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,180
I don't want to say goodbye to everyone, but I am just a dream.

179
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,730
Stars must disappear at sunrise.

180
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,820
Michiru, are you...

181
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,170
I'm a piece of a dream; I was here just as part of a dream.

182
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,120
But you know, it was a really exciting dream.

183
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,340
I was really happy.

184
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,370
Michiru...

185
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,050
The real Michiru...

186
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,760
wasn't allowed to be born in this world, but...

187
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,990
The first time I met Michiru, it was at the station.

188
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,460
Even after my dad left us, I went to the station every day to get him.

189
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,590
He had already quit his job there,

190
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,170
but I didn't have anything else I could do.

191
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,620
Was it then that your mother started calling you Michiru?

192
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,240
Yes, but as long as I was Michiru, Mother kept smiling.

193
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,790
Hijiri told me it was around that time that you stopped laughing much.

194
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,670
It was one summer afternoon after a rain storm...

195
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,640
I felt like I had seen her somewhere before.

196
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,090
No... like she was always with me.

197
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,770
I'm called Michiru.

198
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,460
I am... I am Minagi.

199
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,310
All of this developed out of my sin.

200
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,570
Your sin?

201
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,940
If I hadn't wished for a little sister...

202
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,140
...nobody would have had to dream.

203
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,840
I might even end up hurting Michiru.

204
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,090
But, I still want her to meet someone, someone important.

205
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,370
Hey, wait up!

206
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,850
Nee-chan, hurry up, or we won't be able to get a spot at the fireworks.

207
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,300
I know, but wait!

208
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,090
Oh, I'd fallen asleep.

209
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,390
You played hard all day, you must've been tired.

210
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,720
You must be hungry.

211
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,880
Shall we have supper at my house?

212
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,370
At your house, Minagi?

213
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,750
It's unusual for my daughter to bring friends home,

214
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,260
so I made a special dinner.

215
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,650
Oh, excuse me. I hadn't even asked your name yet.

216
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,360
Ummm... name...

217
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,230
Yes, your name. Could you tell me your name?

218
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,660
Please tell her.

219
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,630
Are you sure?

220
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,010
Um... um...

221
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,330
My name... my name is Michiru!

222
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,750
Michiru?

223
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,730
Ah, so your name is Michiru, is it?

224
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,570
Ah, umm... I'm actually... I'm actually...

225
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm actually...

226
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,430
I'm actually...

227
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,830
Michiru.

228
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,010
That's a wonderful name.

229
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,280
Hamburger steak has always been my daughter's favorite, too.

230
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,870
She always used to say that when she got a little sister, she wanted her to have my hamburger steak.

231
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,950
Isn't that right, Minagi?

232
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,410
Yes.

233
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,530
Here, Michiru-chan.

234
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,170
Eat the hamburger steak before it gets cold.

235
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,340
It's your favorite too, right?

236
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,670
Yeah. Thank you!

237
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,970
How is it? Is it good?

238
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,140
Yes. It's really good!

239
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,340
This is my original recipe.

240
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,510
Here you go. I taught Minagi how to make it.

241
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,530
I can eat this?

242
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,290
Yes. It makes me happy if you eat a lot.

243
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,510
Thank you.

244
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,660
<i>Good-bye...</i>

245
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,370
<i>Mom.</i>

246
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,860
Then, I will keep it for you.

247
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,320
Please take good care of it, Minagi.

248
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,980
Sure.

249
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,550
Michiru?

250
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,420
Michiru? Michiru?!

251
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,050
She didn't even say good-bye.

252
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,610
It's too early... We should still have time.
She didn't even say good-bye.

253
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,810
It's too early... We should still have time.

254
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,480
The stars aren't out yet.

255
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,620
She must be over there.

256
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,210
Michiru.

257
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,500
Michiru, it's not safe.

258
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,150
It's not safe over there, so come over here.

259
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,840
No, I have to go now.

260
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,980
I had so much fun until now.. . So I have to go now.

261
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,740
Don't look like that. You have to keep smiling.

262
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,210
Otherwise, I'll be sad.

263
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,400
Michiru...

264
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,020
I was able to be me because of you.

265
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,970
If you go away, I'm sure I won't be able to laugh anymore.

266
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,320
You'll be okay.

267
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,670
You've learned to laugh with other people, not just me.

268
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,380
Hey, Minagi, Kunisaki Yukito. Let's make a promise.

269
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,630
A promise?

270
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,930
The girl with wings continues to have sad dreams in the sky.

271
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,070
I'm going to return to her first.

272
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,410
I'll return to her with lots of good memories from the two of you.

273
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:55,320
So, if you find her, please tell her many happy things.

274
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,010
And set her free from her sad dreams.

275
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,280
Okay.

276
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,250
Minagi, please keep smiling, always.

277
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,580
Tell me "bye-bye" with a smile.

278
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,240
I can't...

279
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,760
I can't say good-bye with a smile!

280
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,040
Minagi...

281
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,140
But we won't be able to see each other anymore!

282
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,320
It's okay.

283
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,470
Even after you wake up from a dream,

284
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,030
the memories will still be with you.

285
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,650
So, please laugh, and make the memories of me happy ones.

286
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,370
Only you can do that.

287
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,210
Minagi, it's a promise.

288
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,260
Yes...

289
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,290
Are you smiling now?

290
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,600
Yes.

291
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,810
Really?

292
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,340
Yes.

293
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,860
Then, keep smiling. Say bye-bye while smiling for me.

294
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,910
Are you smiling, Michiru?

295
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,580
Yeah.

296
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,800
Our parting isn't hard on you?

297
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,440
No, it's not hard on me. I'm smiling, after all.

298
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,070
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we kept smiling and the world filled with smiles,

299
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,340
and everybody got to live happily?

300
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,650
Yes.

301
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,610
Minagi?

302
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,970
Michiru, bye-bye.

303
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,580
Thank you, Michiru...

304
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,550
Hey, what's up?

305
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,520
You're not running away from home again, are you?

306
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,610
Is that a rice coupon?

307
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,630
It's a letter from my father.

308
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,660
He is inviting me to come see him during my summer break.

309
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,910
Evidently, I have a little sister.

310
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,640
He and his current wife had a baby girl.

311
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,280
That baby's name...!

312
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,390
To be honest with you, I hesitated a little.

313
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,460
But I've decided to meet her.

314
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,230
Mother encouraged me to go, too.

315
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,000
I see.

316
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,270
Tohno!

317
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,540
Wings that cannot fly have a purpose too!

318
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,390
They're precious memories of the days that you spent flying.

319
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,410
Isn't that right, Michiru?

320
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,210
Do you like bubbles?

321
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,230
Yeah, I love them!

322
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,300
But, but you know, I can't blow them very well.

323
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,570
Shall I teach you how to do it?

324
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,470
Really?

325
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,690
Yes. Let's be friends.

326
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,060
I am Minagi. What is your name?

327
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,990
It's, it's...

328
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,550
Misuzu! I'm here!

329
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,730
Hey, Misuzu! Misuzu!

330
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,800
Snap out of it!

331
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,950
Misuzu!

332
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,950
Open your eyes! Misuzu!

333
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,480

1
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,400
Sky...

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,800
I had a dream about my favorite person.

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,930
Yukito came back to me in the end
after all, didn't he?

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,270
He gave me something precious, you know...

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,080
That's why...

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,210
I can't just give up over this, can I?

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,550
I can do it.

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,280
I'll do my best, even if I'm alone.

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,870
We watched the vapor trails

10
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,700
As they disappeared

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,710
We ran from the blinding light

12
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:10,100
In vexation we let go

13
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:18,090
There are still places she cannot reach

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,330
She gazes with wistful eyes

15
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:33,670
Children walk along the tracks in summer

16
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:40,010
In both hands, their wish to take wing

17
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:48,190
We chased and chased vanishing vapor trails

18
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:55,060
Since the day we climbed over that hill

19
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,130
Unfailingly

20
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,830
And just like we have always

21
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,270
Stood straight and tall

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:12,410
We will stay as strong as the god of the sea

23
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,010
Surely

24
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,550
I think I'll try going outside today...

25
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,420
Even though it hurts to walk.

26
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll go as far as I can.

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:36,870
TAKEDA SHOP

28
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,310
TAKEDA SHOP
Let's rest for a bit.

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,440
TAKEDA SHOP

30
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,080
TAKEDA SHOP
I guess I'll have my usual; the weird juice.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,610
TAKEDA SHOP

32
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,550
Ice Cream

33
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,520
It's that person... the one who lived
with us until the other day.

34
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,390
Who could it be?

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,420
I seem to vaguely remember her...

36
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,490
Episode 10

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,470
So, that freeloader left, did he?

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,900
Well, if he finds he has nowhere to go,
he'll probably come back.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,510
I had a tough time, too.

40
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,140
I worked very hard to keep ya here with me.

41
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,080
Yer not my kid.

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,890
One day, you'll be taken
by the Tachibana family.

43
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,580
That's why I couldn't get too involved with ya,
even though we lived together.

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,050
If I started to love ya, it'd make it
that much harder to say goodbye.

45
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,070
I kept myself ready for the day
someone would come for ya.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,500
But it was all for nothing. I love you.

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,970
I can't lie to myself anymore.

48
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,970
So I made up my mind to make you
my own child.

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,810
I did a "sit-in" in front of the Tachibana house.

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,040
They finally gave in.

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,190
You didn't have to do that.

52
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,950
What?

53
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:07,020
I decided to do my best on my own,
and to not be a burden on anybody.

54
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,160
Misuzu!

55
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,060
Misuzu!

56
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,050
What's wrong? Misuzu!

57
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,400
You were feeling that bad?

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,770
I thought it was just a cold.

59
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,910
Your legs won't move?

60
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,510
Let's go to the doctor. I'm sure you'll get better.

61
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,380
Ya know, that female doctor at the clinic.
I'm sure she'll help.

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,620
No hospital can cure me.

63
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,560
Huh?

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,190
Yukito and I figured out
the cause of this problem.

65
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,400
There's another me up in the sky
and she's burdened by something.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,030
That's the reason why my body won't move.

67
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,070
Sounds like something from a dream.

68
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Listen, Mom...

69
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,750
Let's keep on living like before,
without worrying about each other.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,610
What?

71
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,980
Let's live our separate lives.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,720
I'll do my best on my own.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,560
W... Why would you say something like that?

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,650
Are you angry because
I left you alone all this time?

75
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,930
Okay. If you don't want to see a doctor,
you don't have to.

76
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,200
I'll take good care of you.
But two are better than one!

77
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,570
Let's stay strong together!

78
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,340
Okay, Misuzu?

79
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,180
How is it? Isn't it good?

80
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,350
Oh, really?

81
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,160
Sorry. I'll get it right the next time.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,990
I don't want any. The food
you cook never tastes good.

83
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,930
Even if it doesn't taste good,
children grow up eating their parents' cooking.

84
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,940
I'm sorry. Is it so bad that it made you cry?

85
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,740
That's not it.

86
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,740
If we become too close, you'll get sick too.

87
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,840
Was that in your dream too?

88
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,450
Listen to me, Misuzu.

89
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm not the least bit scared of getting sick.

90
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,630
If I get sick, I... I'll be happy.

91
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,760
It'd be a sign that we've grown close.
Isn't that right?

92
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,100
Here, eat something.

93
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,540
It's delicious...

94
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,220
Mom...

95
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,690
What is it?

96
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,540
How short should I cut it?

97
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,550
I'll let you decide, Mom.

98
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,450
Okay, then I'll cut it to a length
that's most flattering for you.

99
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay.

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,320
Mom, you have more wrinkles now.

101
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,990
Shall I give you a crew cut?

102
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,660
Just kidding.

103
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,160
You look young, Mom.

104
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,170
When you came to our open house at school,
everyone else's mothers were older,

105
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,220
so I was really happy.

106
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,800
You answered a question wrong
and started crying.

107
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,010
Yeah... I felt like I had to
show off for you,

108
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,940
so I raised my hand even though
I didn't know the answer.

109
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,210
You came and gave me a whack
in front of everyone.

110
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,520
That's because you said "gao" again.

111
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
That's called disciplining.

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,350
Thanks to you, I've grown into a fine young lady.

113
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,030
That's right. You've grown quite a bit.

114
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,390
You hardly ever say that word anymore.

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,430
Misuzu?

116
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,760
Misuzu?

117
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,410
Well, it's easier this way.

118
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,160
I'll just have to even it all out.

119
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,690
Oh, no! Now the other side is shorter!

120
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,960
Oh, no...

121
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,770
I managed to even out the left and right, but...

122
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,390
It's gotten really short!

123
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,250
I'm sorry!

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,630
It's like I'm back to being a little girl again.

125
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,530
Your little girl.

126
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,630
That's right.

127
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's start all over from here.
The two of us, okay?

128
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,210
Yeah. We'll start from here, right?

129
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,340
V!

130
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,900
V!

131
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,490
Hey, isn't the summer festival soon?

132
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,660
Oh, yeah... That's right. I forgot all about it.

133
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,790
I'd like to go with you, Mom.

134
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,400
Of course! I'll take you.

135
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,170
And then, I want to go to the beach, too.

136
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,800
I've never been there with you.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,570
You have a lot of places you want to go.
Don't you, Misuzu-chin?

138
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,610
Yeah. I want to do a lot of fun
things with you, Mom.

139
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,910
Yes! Let's do all sorts of fun things.

140
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,450
Picture
Diary
Yes! Let's do all sorts of fun things.

141
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,550
Picture
Diary
We'll fill your picture diary with fun things.

142
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,480
You know, Mom...

143
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,450
I'll remember... your smile.

144
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,620
I swear I'll remember it. Mom...

145
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,700
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean, Misuzu?

146
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,510
Oh, you're up, Misuzu?

147
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,100
What's wrong? Are you still sleepy?

148
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,700
Who?

149
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,560
Who are you, lady?

150
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,310
Have you forgotten?

151
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,500
Didn't you agree to be strong
with your mother?

152
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,510
Mommy?

153
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,550
That's right! That's me!

154
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,680
My mommy went far away.

155
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,120
You don't have to remember that.

156
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm taking the place of your mother.

157
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,470
Never mind... I'll win you back starting today.

158
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,500
Until the day you accept me as your mother,
you can call me Aunt Haruko.

159
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,920
Misuzu, see what I've borrowed for you.

160
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,480
Look! Now you can go outdoors.

161
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,220
It hurts too much to walk!

162
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,330
That's why I got you a wheelchair.

163
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,960
Come. I'll give you a push.

164
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,330
It's more fun playing cards by myself.

165
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,040
Come on. Let's play together.
It'll feel good in the sun.

166
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,500
And there are lots of other fun things to do.

167
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,610
The wind is blowing.

168
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,520
Yes, it is.

169
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,920
The sun is sizzling.

170
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, it is.

171
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,220
The cicadas are calling.

172
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes. Noisy, aren't they?

173
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,330
It feels good.

174
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,760
Does it? I'm glad.

175
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,100
TAKEDA SHOP

176
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,800
TAKEDA SHOP
What is the meaning of this?!

177
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,430
Keisuke...

178
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,930
Who is that?

179
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,800
Misuzu, I'm your father.

180
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,910
As you know, this child cannot live
surrounded by too many people.

181
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,220
You live in this quiet town;
that's why I let you have her.

182
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,450
But it was a mistake.

183
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,890
Haven't you heard? This child is mine now.

184
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,160
I got your parents' approval.

185
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,720
She is MY child. Mine and Ikuko's.

186
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,960
You give her to me when she gets in the way,

187
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,800
then come to get her when you
remember about her.

188
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,100
Do you think this home exists
for your convenience?!

189
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,340
How can I leave her here
when I see her wasting away?

190
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,040
Quit talking without your accent!

191
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,310
It creeps me out hearing you talk like that.

192
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,150
Aunty... scary...

193
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,410
Oh, I'm sorry for yelling.

194
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,880
"Aunty"?

195
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,820
N-No... that's not...

196
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,510
Until just a little while ago, she called me "Mom."

197
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,190
Come. Let's go, Misuzu.

198
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,890
Now, say "thank you" to your aunty.

199
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,120
Come on. Where's your "thank you"?

200
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,660
Thank you.

201
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,390
No!
Thank you.

202
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,770
No! No! Don't take Misuzu away from me!

203
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,640
Misuzu has been alone all this time.

204
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,170
And whose fault is that? It's ours!

205
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,340
That's why I've decided to stay with her.

206
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,040
Yet, you want to manipulate her
because of the trouble between us?

207
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,620
Haruko...

208
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,250
I'm not too smart, so I don't know
how to put it nicely...

209
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,750
But one thing's certain.

210
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,460
I want, so much more than you do,
to stay with her!

211
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,430
That's the absolute truth!

212
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,160
Then let's ask her.

213
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,230
Misuzu, do you want to stay with Aunty Haruko?

214
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,370
Aunty?

215
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,930
Yes. Do you want to keep living with Aunty?

216
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,040
Keisuke! Wait, Keisuke!

217
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,310
Three days. Please wait three days.

218
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,010
Lf, at that time, she says she doesn't
want to stay with me...

219
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,120
Then it's okay. You can take Misuzu away.

220
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm begging you, Keisuke!

221
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,290
Three days...

222
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,990
Can I regain our mother-child
relationship in that time?

223
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:54,230
Misuzu, you really love dinosaurs, don't you?

224
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,780
This is a Maiasaura.
It means "good mother lizard."

225
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,080
Really? It sounds like me.

226
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,520
This is a Velociraptor. It means "swift thief."

227
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,450
That sounds like Keisuke!

228
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,090
I wonder which one of us is the thief...

229
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,600
It's hot...

230
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,040
It is, isn't it? Just hang on for a bit.

231
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,470
It should be cooler at the beach.

232
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,380
Let's have our lunch there:
The lunch that I made.

233
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,510
I want to go home.

234
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,050
Don't say that. Our lunch will go to waste.

235
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,080
I want to go home!

236
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,180
There are sweet egg rolls, too.

237
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,050
I made them because you asked for them.
Let's make this a fun day.

238
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,080
No.

239
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,990
You really want to go home?

240
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,090
Yes...

241
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,900
But what about the lunch that I made?

242
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,420
I don't know.

243
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,870
I see... Then just do whatever you want!

244
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,710
If you want so much to play by yourself,
find your own way home!

245
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,900
You little fool!

246
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,010
It's hot. I'm getting dizzy.

247
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,090
Gao...

248
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,720
Let's go...

249
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,840
Let's go home, Misuzu.

250
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,490
I've known it all along.

251
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,760
I'm not cut out to be a mother.
That's all there is to it.

252
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,830
What a thing for me to do!

253
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,530
Misuzu! What's wrong?

254
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,430
Catch it!

255
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,580
Catch that cicada.

256
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,290
Okay. I'll catch it for you!
I'm the Old Cicada Catcher!

257
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,150
The Old Cicada Catcher?

258
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,610
That's right. Scaredy-cats
like you need me, right?

259
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
There it is!

260
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,320
Got it!

261
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,300
Now you can play without worrying, right?

262
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,070
Yes...

263
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,600
Okay. I guess I'll be going, then.

264
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,820
Is it okay for Aunty to stay here?

265
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,980
Yes.

266
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,730
I'm not going to ask for much anymore.

267
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,440
I'll be happy if I can just spend one day with you.

268
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,770
That's all I wish for.

269
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,650
This is the day I promised Keisuke.

270
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,190
That fool. He'll ask you once more.

271
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,860
Then you'll probably say
you want to go with him.

272
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,590
You'll probably say you don't want to
stay with me anymore.

273
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,880
Summer vacation is a long way from ending,

274
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,180
but our summer vacation ends today.

275
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,420
Are you sure?

276
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,560
TAKEDA SHOP
Yeah. I'm sure.

277
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,860
TAKEDA SHOP
I see.

278
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,490
TAKEDA SHOP

279
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,590
TAKEDA SHOP
Listen, Keisuke.

280
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,230
TAKEDA SHOP
There's one final place I want to go with her.

281
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,460
TAKEDA SHOP
Do you have time?

282
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,600
Misuzu. This is the sea.

283
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,630
It's the sea.

284
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,740
Isn't it beautiful?

285
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,880
It was so far. How many years
did it take us to get here, I wonder?

286
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,820
We could have enjoyed this beautiful view
any time we wanted.

287
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,760
What in the world were we doing?

288
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,200
Have you had enough time?

289
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,040
She's heavy. It's been a long time
since you carried her.

290
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,000
It's thanks to you that she's grown
this big. Thank you.

291
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,020
Oh, yeah... Let her hold on to this.

292
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,090
She loves this doll.

293
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,020
She should be able to sleep comfortably
if she's holding this.

294
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,030
If she's still fussy, give her this to drink.

295
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,690
It's her favorite juice.

296
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,350
Got it. Well...

297
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,410
Shouldn't you go, too?

298
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,460
Your princess is going away.

299
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,410
That fool! What is he doing?!

300
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,070
Misuzu!

301
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,640
Mommy!

302
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,720
Misuzu!

303
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,420
Mommy! Mommy!

304
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,300
That's right, I'm your mother.

305
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,500
Mommy...

306
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:47,750
After that, the two of them talked
for a long time in the sunset.

307
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,290
I'll bring a reliable doctor,
so please let him check her.

308
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,460
I finally realized that...

309
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,970
this person who'd been
with Misuzu all this time...

310
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,440
was her mother.

311
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,720
Catching hold of the remnant

312
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,020
Of a dream that fades to white

313
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,790
The young boy runs

314
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,040
When he lets go

315
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,270
It vanishes forever with

316
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,050
The cry of the wind

317
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:55,680
A gentleness, once so apparent, is now gone

318
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:06,860
My eyes remain on the steps my feet take

319
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:15,610
Hearing forever the sounds of singing

320
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,250
That had faded away by morning

321
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:37,660
Always following in the footsteps we left behind

323
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,630
Next Episode
I had wings.

324
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,700
Next Episode
I was flying through the sky
with pure white wings.

325
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,600
I was flying through the sky
with pure white wings.

326
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,270
Is that so? What a nice dream.

327
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:55,340
No, it was a sad dream.
The world's saddest dream.

328
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,550
But you know, that was my last dream.

329
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,180
From now on I will stay with you.

330
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,120
Forever and always...

331
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,890
Final Episode

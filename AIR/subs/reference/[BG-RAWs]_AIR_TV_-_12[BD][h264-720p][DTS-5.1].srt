1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,820
When I think about it,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,120
I think everything that's happened has been
a trial for me to become your real mother.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,160
The paralysis in your legs and
your memory loss...

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,600
They happened to prepare me to start
over from the day we met.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,460
Mommy...

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,470
Misuzu! Misuzu, hang on!

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,500
Where does it hurt?

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,210
I'll rub it for you.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,040
Ow... It hurts, Mommy.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,010
Is it here? Does it hurt here?

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,170
No.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,080
Is it your leg? Your arm?

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,410
My wings...

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,070
What?!
My wings...

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,620
My wings... hurt...

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,590
Misuzu will start to forget:
About me and about you.

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,760
And when she has her last dream,

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,270
she's probably going to die.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,530
It can't be true.

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,240
If she falls asleep...

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,290
If she has a dream, she'll...

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,140
Misuzu, you're going to the summer
festival, aren't you?

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,540
You're going to the summer festival
with Mom, aren't you?

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,250
I want to go to the festival.

25
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,510
I want a baby dinosaur.

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,220
You mean a chick, right?
I'm sure there will be a stand there.

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,620
Can I buy a dinosaur?

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,760
Sure! We'll have some good things to eat, too.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,930
Let's make tomorrow the best day ever!

30
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,490
So please get better, Misuzu!

Misuzu, it's morning.
The summer festival is today.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,100
Yeah...

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,790
The festival...

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,430
Final Episode

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,780
Please, gods. Please do something. Sis!

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,530
I'm such a fool. There's no way
they'll be holding it.

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,260
There'll never be a miracle.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,630
The gods don't really exist.

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,440
What did this child do wrong, anyway?!

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,910
She waited like a very good little girl!

54
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,740
She was so looking forward
to the summer festival!

55
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,010
Why can't she be rewarded?!

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
It's just like that time.

57
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,280
I can't give you anything this time, either.

58
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,920
Mommy, where's the baby dinosaur?

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Why?

60
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,040
Why is it here?

61
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,080
I threw it away.

62
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,580
So, it's been waiting all this time.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,550
Misuzu! Misuzu, wake up.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,130
What is it, Mommy?

65
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,900
There's a dinosaur here. Right over there!

66
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,430
Let's go and get it together. Okay?

67
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,970
Come on, a little more...

68
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,140
Mom will help you.

69
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,910
This will be a happy memory for the two of us.

70
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,250
Let's take good care of it together.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,490
I'm tired. I'm sleepy...

72
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,520
No, no! Do your best. I'll help you!

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,960
Your friend is here too.

74
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,600
We're all in this together.
Let's all find happiness together.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,030
Okay.

76
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,230
A little further...
A little more, and you'll reach our happiness.

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
There! You got it!

78
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,710
I did it!

79
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,820
It's my birthday present to you.

80
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,890
I haven't been able to give you one
since the day we met,

81
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,690
but will you accept one now?

82
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,360
Yes. I'm so happy.

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,620
You are? Isn't it nice, Misuzu?

84
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,330
It's so cute.

85
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,300
He says, "Gao!"

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,460
Gao...

87
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,470
Dear gods, I offer my thanks.

88
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,100
Mom...

89
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,910
She hasn't slept... because of me.

90
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Oh, dear. I was asleep, wasn't I?

91
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,290
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,750
It's okay. Let's go to sleep.
I want to sleep with you, Mom.

93
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,200
What should I do?

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,600
If you go to sleep and dream,
your pains will get worse, won't they?

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,570
No. There's no pain now.

96
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,470
What?

97
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,440
There's been no pain for a while now.

98
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,960
I wonder why...

99
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,180
Really? You really don't feel any pain?

100
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,510
That's why I want to sleep.
I want to sleep lots and get better.

101
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,980
Really?

102
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,550
I'm so glad! It's really great, isn't it, Misuzu?

103
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,850
You were trying so hard, weren't you?

104
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,350
You were rewarded, Misuzu!

105
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,300
Misuzu... no... That's not candy...

106
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
You mustn't eat it...

107
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,870
I'm sorry for lying, Mom.

108
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,570
If I didn't, you wouldn't have rested.

109
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,540
Yukito...

110
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,880
Picture Diary

111
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,550
Picture Diary
I think I'll write in my diary.

112
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,980
I think I'll write in my diary.

113
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,630
Misuzu!

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,200
I was asleep!

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,970
Isn't your body sore?

116
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,940
Do you remember who I am?

117
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,570
Mom! Good morning!

118
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,750
It's cleared up nicely,
now that the storm's passed.

119
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,050
Mom, I had another dream last night.

120
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,620
A dream?

121
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,490
You always get worse after a dream.

122
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm fine. I have no pains anywhere.

123
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Besides, that was my last dream.

124
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,570
Really? You're really all right?
You don't feel any pain anywhere?

125
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,570
I'm fine.

126
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,430
V!

127
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,210
Really?

128
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,240
That freeloader said something about
after your last dream...

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,710
But I guess he was wrong.

130
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I was so worried.

131
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,750
It was like living a long nightmare.
But it's finally over, isn't it?

132
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,420
Mom...

133
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,390
I can't tell you not to cry; I'm a crybaby myself.

134
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,390
Ya mustn't cry, now.

135
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,900
That's right. There's nothing sad,
so I shouldn't cry, should I?

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,240
My dream last night was about
a dinosaur with wings.

137
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,650
He was flying like he really
enjoyed it, saying, "Gao!"

138
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,710
Is that right?

139
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,810
And I was flying above him.
I was looking back over my shoulder.

140
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,330
I had wings. I was flying with pure white wings.

141
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,920
Is that so? What a nice dream.

142
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,430
No, it was a sad dream.

143
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,130
The world's saddest dream.

144
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,370
But you know, that was my last dream.

145
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,740
From now on I will stay with you.

146
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,270
Forever and always...

147
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,780
It sure feels good, doesn't it?

148
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,340
Yeah. It sure feels good, doesn't it?

149
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,790
It smells like summer.

150
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,160
Yeah. It does.

151
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,760
What does it smell like?

152
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,130
The sea.

153
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,330
That's right. It does.

154
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,930
It smells like the sun.

155
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,430
That's right. It does, at that.

156
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,970
It smells like you, Mom.

157
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,200
Yes. It does, doesn't it?

158
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,900
Yuck! It would be awful if it smelled like me!

159
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,880
It smells a lot like you, Mom.

160
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,340
Are you sure?

161
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,580
Yes. This summer smelled a lot like you, Mom.

162
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,670
The smell of my favorite Mother.

163
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,490
It would be awful if I was smelly.

164
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,050
It would be awful!

165
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,820
But, it smelled good.

166
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,460
Did it? That's nice.

167
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,690
Uh-huh. It was.

168
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,200
It's hot, isn't it?

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,330
Yes, it's very hot.

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,240
Say, Misuzu, shall I tell you what
you're thinking now?

171
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,610
Yeah.

172
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,440
I wish I could have some juice.

173
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,580
You're right! That's amazing!

174
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,980
Anybody could guess that.

175
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,450
Very Very Very Very
Thick Thick Thick Thick
Milk Peach Gerurun Bitter
Flavor Flavor Melon
Anybody could guess that.

176
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,520
Very Very Very Very
Thick Thick Thick Thick
Milk Peach Gerurun Bitter
Flavor Flavor Melon
I want this one.

177
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,550
Very Very Very Very
Thick Thick Thick Thick
Milk Peach Gerurun Bitter
Flavor Flavor Melon
This again?

178
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,220
This again?

179
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,410
You sure like this, don't you?

180
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,690
And what shall I have?

181
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,660
You should have that Gerurun juice.

182
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,390
Really?

183
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,820
Very Thick
Gerurun

184
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,640
It's not just thick, it's hard!

185
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
Who wants juice like this?!

186
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,500
Don't throw it away!

187
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,040
You're supposed to squeeze it while you drink.

188
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,540
Like this?

189
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,280
Well, it's not all that bad...

190
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,050
It's summer vacation, isn't it?

191
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,320
Summer vacation for just you and me.

192
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,260
But that's okay. We can play together.

193
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,850
Listen, Mom. I want you to go ahead a little.

194
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,330
Why? Is there a reason?

195
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,460
Yes. Take Sky with you.

196
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,310
Is this far enough?

197
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,740
Yeah. Wait there.

198
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,580
Don't push yourself!

199
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,750
Stand there, Mom!

200
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:42,780
Huh?
Stand there, Mom!

201
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,380
Huh?

202
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,480
Huh?
Don't come, no matter what happens.

203
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,540
Don't come, no matter what happens.

204
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,350
I'm going to do it myself.

205
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,990
I'm going to do my best to walk up to you.

206
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,220
You'll be my goal, Mom.

207
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,190
I see. So I'm the goal?

208
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,660
Yes. You and Sky are my goal.

209
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,730
Just take it slowly. I'll wait as long as you need.

210
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,470
Okay.

211
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,840
Are you all right?

212
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
Yeah! V!

213
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,970
V...

214
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,400
Over here, Misuzu. I'm over here.

215
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,610
That's right. Just take it slowly.

216
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,780
If you try really hard, I'm sure you'll get well.

217
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,750
We'll do our best together. Right, Misuzu?

218
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,190
It's all right, isn't it?

219
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
Huh? What is?

220
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,530
I've done my best, haven't I?

221
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,800
It's okay to cross the goal line, isn't it?

222
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,330
Are you tired already?

223
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay, when you reach your goal,
we'll go home and play cards.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,670
No...

225
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,500
My goal... The goal I've been trying
to reach all this time...

226
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,740
Huh?

227
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,140
I did my best, so it's okay, isn't it?

228
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,450
I can rest now, can't I?

229
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,290
Don't tell me you're in pain?
Have you been in pain?

230
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,650
Don't move!

231
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,360
It's not true. Tell me it's not true!

232
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,130
You're going to get better, aren't you?

233
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,100
The bad dreams are supposed to be over, right?

234
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

235
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,940
But I was able to do all that I needed to.

236
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,110
That's why, I'm going to cross the goal line.

237
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,350
No, Misuzu. You mustn't come here.
You mustn't cross the goal line!

238
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,010
We just started! Why, we just started yesterday!

239
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,990
We're going to get it all back.

240
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,320
The happy life that we should have started
ten years ago.

241
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,260
We're going to get that all back together!

242
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,560
Our happiness just started!

243
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,230
No, we did everything.
Almost more than enough.

244
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,100
This summer was filled with enough
happiness for a lifetime.

245
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,110
No! You're wrong! There are lots
of things I want to do!

246
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,340
I love you, Misuzu. There are lots
of things I want to do with you!

247
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,480
Everything is just beginning!

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,850
This summer, I decided I would try
one more time.

249
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,840
My summer started on the day I met Yukito.

250
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,690
All sorts of things happened;
painful things, difficult things...

251
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,990
But I'm glad I tried so hard.

252
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,070
My goal was the same as my happiness.

253
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,400
I wasn't all alone.

254
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,910
That's why... That's why
I'm going to cross the goal line.

255
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,910
No! We've only started!

256
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,670
We've only started, I tell you!

257
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,710
Goal!

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,580
I may not be an admirable one,
but I'm her mother.

324
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,020
I may not be an admirable one,
but I'm her mother.
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai
where there are so many memories

325
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,820
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai
where there are so many memories

326
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,850
I've decided to quit my job and
get a job at a nursery school.
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai

327
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,590

328
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,860
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai
That you need nothing else

329
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,430
I want to live surrounded by all sorts of families.
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai
That you need nothing else

330
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,660
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai
That you need nothing else

331
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,330
That's what I'm thinking.
Takusan no omoide ga aru hoka ni wa nani mo iranai gurai
That you need nothing else

332
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,300

That you need nothing else

333

Hitomi wo tojireba sugu ano umi no nioi
lf you close your eyes, you can catch the scent of that sea

334
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,730
I'll come and visit you sometime.
Hitomi wo tojireba sugu ano umi no nioi
lf you close your eyes, you can catch the scent of that sea

335
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,270
Yeah. I'll be waiting.

337
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,640
The end of summer...
Hitomi wo tojireba sugu ano umi no nioi
lf you close your eyes, you can catch the scent of that sea

338
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,510
It's the end of my vacation, too.

lf you close your eyes, you can catch the scent of that sea

340
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,040
So many happy things
happened this summer.
I even got a baby dinosaur.
It was great.

Mata natsu ga kuru gin iro ni hikaru
Summer will come once more, glowing silver

Summer will come once more, glowing silver

344
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,360
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

345
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,830
Is that you, Sky?
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

346
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,560
You've grown quite a bit, haven't you?
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

347
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,030
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

348
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,470
Or, are you a different crow? I can't tell.
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,000
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

350
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,510
But, if you're Sky,
I should scold you, shouldn't I?
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

351
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,440
Are you still hanging around here?
That child isn't here anymore.
Minamo ni utsusu futaribun no kage
Two shadows on the surface of the water

352
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,400
Are you still hanging around here?
That child isn't here anymore.

353
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,280
You know, you have to leave.
You've got wings, after all.

354
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,510
The sky is way out of reach
for us wingless people.

355
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,890
So, you have to fly!

356
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,790
For people like us who have no wings.

357
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,060
Take all of our dreams and hopes to the sky!
I'm counting on you!

358
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,680
Then we'll be able to live peaceful lives.

359
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,670
That's what I think.

360
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,150
I hope we'll be able to meet again someday.

361
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,380
Well, take care of yourself!

362
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,160
Before I realized it, I was looking at the sky.

363
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,500
The sky that always bore a taint of sadness.

364
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,440
Blue that continued into infinity.

365
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,240
The young girl who returned to that eternity.

366
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,180
That girl who still remains alone.

367
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,750
That is why I shall continue
on a journey to find that girl.

368
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,750
And one day, I shall bring her home.

369
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,960
In order to greet a new beginning.

370
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,870
My son, heed my words.

371
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,540
The story I'm about to tell
is a very important one.

372
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,920
You and I begin now the story of
a long, long journey

373
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,080
which will be passed on from
parent to child without end.

374
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,760
We will pass on the memories of this planet.

375
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,660
We will bear witness to every
phenomenon on this planet,

376
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,600
and pass them on from parent to child.

377
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,630
The memories of the planet
must eternally be happy ones.

378
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,710
When the skies are clouded
over by hatred and wars

379
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,340
this planet will be overwhelmed by grief
and all will be lost.

380
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,220
Someday, the day of destruction will come.

381
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,150
That end cannot be avoided.

382
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,390
But, in the end...

383
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:51,760
May the last child who shoulders the memories
of this planet have only happy memories.

384
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,730
What's the matter?

385
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,910
Nothing.

386
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,670
I was just remembering
something from the past.

387
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,610
The sun will be setting soon.

388
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,340
I guess...

389
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,620
Before that, do you want to go check it out?

390
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,280
Check what out?

391
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,490
The thing you've always wanted to check out.

392
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,590
What's beyond this shoreline.

393
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,220
Did I say that?

394
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,660
Maybe you didn't...

395
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,650
But I got the feeling you were thinking it.

396
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,270
You're right. I want to check it out.

397
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,340
If we go now, we can find out
what's waiting out there... you and I.

398
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,080
Shall we go?

399
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,940
Okay.
Shall we go?

400
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,520
For them, cruel days await.

401
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,980
For us, it's the beginning.

402
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,690
Good-bye...

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,910

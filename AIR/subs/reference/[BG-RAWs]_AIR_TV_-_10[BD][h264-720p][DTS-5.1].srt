00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,180
The Day Before the
School Closing Ceremony
My name is Misuzu, Misuzu Kamio.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,410
My name is Misuzu, Misuzu Kamio.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,150
I have to give you a name, too.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,090
Isn't that the guy who was on the bank?
That we met on our way home from school?

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,930
Nobody's interested in a puppet show
like that these days.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,960
Boy, am I hungry!

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,270
I've got it! Sky!

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,630
I'll call you Sky.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,970
That's where I always stand to look at the sky...

Hello.

24
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,950
It doesn't look like he's sick...

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,320
Sitting like this, it's almost like we're friends.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,490
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,730
I wish I could play with someone like that...

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,070
Oh! Bye-bye!

29
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,480
Episode 10

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,330
What's that black thing?!

31
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,130
He followed me.

32
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,200
It looks like he's too little to fly yet.

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm surprised he's so friendly.

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,040
I gave him a name: Sky.

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,900
And we're going to live together.

36
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,370
No way!

37
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,740
Oh, that was quick.

38
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,940
If it's a pet you want, get a cat or dog.

39
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,610
Having something like this around
would be depressing.

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,450
That's not true.

41
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,610
He's cute. Here, say hello to Mom.

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,780
MY EYE!

43
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,730
Mom was really mad, wasn't she?

44
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll sneak you into my room tonight.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,190
Let's apologize to her tomorrow, okay?

46
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,810
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

47
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,800
I think I'm going to try and invite some
of my classmates over.

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,710
But, I wonder if they'd want to play with me...

49
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,370
I think I'll practice what to say.

50
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,450
Uh... I'd love it if you'd
play with me this summer.

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,090
Oh, I have remedial classes,
so it'll have to be in the afternoons.

52
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,960
We could go swimming,
or play card games, play with fireworks...

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,400
and we could do homework together.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,700
I'd just copy yours, so I'd have it easy...

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm just joking.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,560
I'd do my best too.

57
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,600
I feel braver now.

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,270
I'll be back at noon,
so just play by yourself.

59
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,670
Don't go too far, now.

60
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,970
Piko?

61
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,220
Piko, piko, piko, piko...

62
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,990
Piko piko piko piko piko piko.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,020
Pikori.

64
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,720
Piko?

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,020
Piko!

66
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,390
Piko! Piko piko!

67
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,070
Oh! Look, a crow!

68
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,710
Oh, it's true! He's pitch black!

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,370
No! He's creepy!

70
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,480
What? He's cute.

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,110
Oh, no! He's coming this way!

72
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,010
Oh, he ran away!

73
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,340
Wait!

74
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,890
What's this? A crow!

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,150
Where did you come from?

76
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,420
Don't worry.

77
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,400
I won't be mean to you.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,340
No, don't! I can't take that off yet.

79
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,910
If I take it off when I'm grown up,
I'll have magic powers, you see.

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,850
There are cars on the roads,
so you'd better be careful.

81
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,510
So long!

82
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,860
Hey, hey, how about going to the beach?

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,760
Okay, sure! My bathing suit this year
is super daring.

84
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,230
What?!

85
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,800
I mustn't cry. Hold it in.

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,640
Sky...

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,050
I'm going to be all alone again
this summer, after all.

88
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,280
I couldn't get anyone to play with me.

89
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,150
They all know about it...
that I'm not a normal girl.

90
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,520
But, I'll do something really fun by myself.

91
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,560
For my independent research I'll do a picture
diary and write about all the fun things I did.

92
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,100
So... So I'll be fine.

93
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,870
It's that person from yesterday.

94
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,480
I really don't want to be all alone.

95
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,450
Such a long vacation...

96
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,580
I don't want to be the only one all alone!

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,320
So I'm going to try talking to that guy.

98
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,190
If he seems like a nice person,
I'll ask him to play with me.

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,590
Keep smiling, now, and try to act natural.

100
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,130
A-a ramen set!

101
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,390
Hello. Are you alone?

102
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,590
What's going on here?

103
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,030
Why is there another one?
And another one! And another one!

104
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,060
Why, I said it three times!

105
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,270
Just shows ya what a shock it was for me.

106
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,540
But Mom...

107
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Absolutely not!

108
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,530
It's nothing like you said.

109
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,850
Well, you do seem to have pluck.
I like that about ya.

110
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,650
That's right. Yukito is a really nice guy.

111
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,390
All right. He can stay.

112
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:53,950
You're serious?
All right. He can stay.

113
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,390
You're serious?
Serious? Why, I'm dead serious.

114
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,880
Serious? Why, I'm dead serious.

115
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,920
So his name's Yukito Kunisaki, huh?

116
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,530
He seems to get along well with Misuzu,

117
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,290
but she hasn't had another one of
those episodes, ya know?

118
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,670
So he just might be able to
become Misuzu's friend.

119
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,440
Because of that illness of hers,

120
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,700
she hasn't been able to make a single friend.

121
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,030
Besides, he doesn't seem to be a bad guy.
I want to take a chance on him.

122
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,980
Don't you have a different one?

123
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,340
All of the other ones are small.

124
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,290
It smells nice.

125
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,290
Sky...

126
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,890
Yukito and Mom are going to work.

127
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,290
I have to go to school.
You watch the house, okay?

128
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,760
I wonder if they're out...

129
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,810
I bought this for them,
but what should I do with it?

130
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,260
What in the world are ya doing out here?

131
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,220
You should be at home!

132
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,500
But I'm glad I ran into you here.

133
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,760
Why don't ya come with me?

134
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,420
There's going to be a festival here soon.

135
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,150
It's the tenth Summer Festival
since that summer.

136
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,950
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

137
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,760
She sat in front of the chick stand
for a long time, talking to them.

138
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,690
She kept saying "Gao! Gao!"

139
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,200
Ya know, that girl thought that chicks
grow up to be dinosaurs!

140
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,160
But the chicks ya buy at the fairs
don't last long, ya know.

141
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,810
I took her hand and tried to drag her home.

142
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,940
Then, ya know...

143
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,010
That child, who always seemed to believe
that she mustn't cause anyone any trouble...

144
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,420
Well, she stared at me and said,

145
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,390
"I wish I could have one..."

146
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,750
She sounded so apologetic.

147
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,710
Misuzu wasn't a wanted child.

148
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,660
She was born to an unwed couple
who were always bickering.

149
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,530
Then my big sister died,
leaving the father and her daughter.

150
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,100
Then the father forced me to take his child.

151
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,180
I tell ya, I had a rough time of it.

152
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:37,880
I lived from day to day, believing that
that man would come for his child any day soon.

153
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,720
But, after spending so much time
with that child...

154
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,590
She's always hasty and so clumsy,

155
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,830
but she forgets those things
and is always laughing...

156
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,630
I can't help laughing along with her.

157
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,340
Still, I'm not her mother.

158
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,440
That guy might come to take her away any day.

159
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,040
Then... like it or not,
I'll have to return to living alone.

160
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,880
I didn't want to seem so pitiful
when that happens,

161
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,250
so all I could do was try to protect
my own way of life.

162
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,560
That's why I've never given her
a birthday present.

163
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,800
Every year, I'd make believe I forgot.

164
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,200
I've been debating all this time
about what to do this year.

165
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,540
I won't give it to her, after all!

166
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,700
It's too late for us to become a real family.

167
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,680
That person... and this view...

168
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,210
I'm sure I've seen them somewhere before.

169
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,550
But when? Where?

170
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,190
I just can't remember...

171
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,430
Oh! A cicada flew in through the vent again!

172
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,030
Oh! The soy sauce bottle fell over!

173
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,230
Oh! The salad oil spilled!

174
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,630
Oh! I messed up Yukito's bacon and eggs!

175
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,580
Yukito, is it good?

176
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,350
Yeah.

177
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,420
Really?

178
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,180
Yeah.

179
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,990
It doesn't taste like cicada?

180
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,350
What do you mean by that?!

181
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,290
Nothing. Nothing.

182
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,980
G-gao.

183
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,130
Hey, where are you going?

184
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,590
What a weird crow.

185
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,630
Please make my big sister Saika all better.

186
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,600
Mommy... Are there really gods?

187
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,310
Of course there are.

188
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,650
The gods are watching over you and Saika.

189
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,450
I'm sure your wish will come true.

190
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,210
Oh!

191
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,670
Mommy! This is a god.

192
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,630
It was walking all by itself.

193
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,840
It looks new.

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,600
Let's leave it here, because
this is the house of the gods.

195
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,700
Okay.

196
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,160
Oh, my... Are you all by yourself?

197
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,630
You don't fly away, do you? How clever.

198
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,430
If you don't have a home, won't you come
with me to the station?

199
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,740
I think you would make
a good friend for Michiru.

200
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,970
And you'll have all the food you can eat.

201
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,170
You'll be ultra-happy...

202
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,400
I see... You have a home to return to.

203
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,680
I hope you'll keep trying,

204
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,080
so that you'll be able to fly one day.

205
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,500
Just think about how I feel, being called out to
your school each time you have an episode.

206
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,930
Yer fine when yer with that
freeloader, aren't ya?

208
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,090
I thought you'd gotten over them.

209
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,730
Well, I'm going back to work.

210
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,940
I'm sorry to trouble you.

211
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,720
Mom was angry, wasn't she?

212
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,960
But you know... She came to school
so quickly. She always does.

213
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,890
Yukito must be waiting.

214
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,090
I wonder if he's worried.

215
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,200
I have to do the best I can
to act as if nothing happened.

216
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,700
I'll just tell him it slipped my mind
that he was waiting.

217
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,660
I want Yukito to think I'm just an ordinary girl.

218
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,070
Misuzu, I'm home.

219
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,710
I'm home!

220
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,190
All of a sudden, Misuzu...

221
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,490
I know.

222
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,560
Sky...

223
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,370
Mom says Yukito has gone away.

224
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,230
I wanted to be with him longer.

225
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,940
But he says he'll walk me to and from
school like before.

226
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,340
So I have to be patient.

227
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,350
I'll still be able to see him every day.

228
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,520
Ouch...

229
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,650
I wonder what's wrong...
Sometimes I get a pain in my back.

230
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,460
Why did you take Misuzu in?

231
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,700
That's why she can't lean on you.

232
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,300
Think about it! For her, you are her only parent!

233
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,400
What a mean thing to say.

234
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,940
He didn't have to tell me. I've always known that.

235
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,240
How long do I have to live like this, I wonder...

236
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,890
Never giving her a birthday gift,

237
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,950
always scared that she'll be gone one day.

238
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,330
I've made up my mind.

239
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,330
I'm making her my daughter.

240
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,160
I'll march into the Tachibana house
and negotiate with them.

241
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,070
Yeah, I thought I'd get away by myself,
visit some hot springs.

242
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,410
What are you thinking? What about Misuzu?

243
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,710
Misuzu, I'll be back.

244
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,120
If I stay with you any longer,
neither one of us will survive.

245
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
So, I've decided to run away from you.

246
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,390
Well, then, I guess that's how it has to be.
We have no choice, do we?

247
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,230
I had a fun summer vacation...
a summer vacation with you.

248
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,470
I had fun, too.

249
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
Really?

250
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,570
Yeah.

251
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,160
Well, I'd better go.

252
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,030
Bye-bye, Yukito.

253
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,820
He's gone...

254
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,490
I'm going to be all alone. Really alone...

255
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,530
If I'm all alone, I won't be able to keep strong.

256
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,500
What should I do?

257
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,770
I just had a good idea.

258
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
I should go on the trip, too.

259
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,540
Then Yukito and I won't have to be separated.

260
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,230
That's a good idea...

261
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,640
It's not that I want to leave this house.

262
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
I just have to stay away from you.

263
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,920
Stay strong.

264
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,850
Stay strong, even if you're alone.

265
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,890
Yes, I'll stay strong even if I'm alone.

266
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,860
I'm a tough kid.

267
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,060
That's my girl. Bye, now.

268
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,940
I'm all alone now...

269
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,000
Really, all alone...

270
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,910
Yukito...

271
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,520
Mom...

272
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,950
Ow...

273
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,950
It hurts so much!

274
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,830
I've been alone until today.
And I'll be alone from now on, too.

275
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,000
Even if I do my best, I just cause
trouble for other people.

276
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,620
There's not a single good thing about me.

277
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:47,270
I should've just continued to resign myself,
like I've always done.

278
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,000
I should've never learned to love anyone.

279
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,200
I'll go to sleep.

280
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,170
I don't have to wake up again.

281
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,420
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

282
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,450
All I needed to do to be happy was
to be here with you, and watch you laugh.

283
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,130
Why?

284
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,060
I thought I wouldn't be able to get up anymore...

285
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,370
Yukito! Where are you?

286
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,630
You came back, didn't you?

287
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,670
Oh, yeah... I remember now.

288
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,180
I was once a human.

289
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,270
I was a human named Yukito Kunisaki.

290
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,450
And I was near Misuzu.

291
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,190
Hey, I got better. I think I'll be okay.

292
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,790
Hey, Yukito?

293
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,050
Misuzu...

294
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,630
I'm here... I'm here.

295
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,540
Yukito!

296
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,940
Misuzu...

297
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,150
Yukito...

298
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,850
Yukito... Yukito!

299
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,860
Misuzu...

300
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,190
I'm going to do my best.

301
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,530
I'll show you.

302
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:54,730
So, so please don't go anywhere.
Stay by my side.

303
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,100
Yukito...

304
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,000
You'll be all right.

305
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,970
You're a strong girl, so I'm sure
you'll be able to reach it...

306
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,980
that goal that no one else
has been able to reach.

307
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,340
I'm sure you'll make it.

308
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,370
I don't want you to go away. Don't go!

309
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,920
I'll always be near you.
I'll never forget you.

310
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,430
I'll be with you.

311
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,090
Yukito?

312
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,230
Yukito?!

313
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,130
Oh... My mind is getting hazy again.

314
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,040
But Misuzu, I'll be with you.
I'll be with you forever.

315
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,700
Yukito! Wait! Don't go...

316
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,470
Let's stay strong, Misuzu.

317
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,840
Stay strong until you reach the goal, Misuzu.

318
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,090
Okay. I'll stay strong.

319
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,150
Let's stay strong, Yukito.

Mommy?

337
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,000
That's right. That's me.

338
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Mommy went far away.

339
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,510
Misuzu...

340
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,100
I'm your father.

341

No!

342
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,210
If she says she doesn't want to stay with me...
Then it's okay. You can take Misuzu away.

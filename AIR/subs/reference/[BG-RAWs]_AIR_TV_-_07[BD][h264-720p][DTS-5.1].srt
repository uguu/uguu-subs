1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,990
What in the heck happened?

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,320
I was shocked when I found you on the floor.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,160
I got dizzy all of a sudden
and my feet got tangled.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm sorry that I made you worry.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,400
Maybe you're slightly anemic.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,100
What do you want to do?
Do you want to go see a doctor?

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,690
No, I'll be all right. I think I just need some rest.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,870
The remedial classes have started.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,170
Missing one day isn't going to
make any difference.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,180
You should rest today.

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,180
Okay.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,910
What about your job today?

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,500
I'll take the day off.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,320
July 21 (Thur)
Weather: Clear
I went to school with Yukito.
It was really fun.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,620
July 21 (Thur)
Weather: Clear
I went to school with Yukito.
It was really fun.
I went to school with Yukito.

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:40,820
I went to school with Yukito.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,720
I played with Yukito.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,020
A cicada flew into Yukito's breakfast.

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,460
I went to the train station with Yukito.

20
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,900
I went to the shrine with Yukito.

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,030
You shouldn't look in someone else's diary.

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,390
Don't you have anything else to write about?

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,340
I think I'm doing a good job, though...

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,410
Well, to be blunt, you don't have
any talent for diary-writing.

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,780
So from now on, instead of writing about
what you did, write about what you want to do.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,850
But then, it's not a diary.

27
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,550
Yes it is,

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,020
because I'll make all of those things come true.

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,020
I want to go to the ocean... with you, Yukito.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,160
We've never gone down to the beach together.

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,200
I want to dig in the sand and
pick up pretty seashells.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,430
You can see the ocean anytime, can't you?

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,470
Gao!

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,710
Ouch!

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,110
Fine.

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,170
I'll go to the beach with you.

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,980
Yeah!

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,850
We watched the vapor trails

39
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,690
As they disappeared

40
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,690
We ran from the blinding light

41
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:04,090
In vexation we let go

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:12,070
There are still places she cannot reach

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,320
She gazes with wistful eyes

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,660
Children walk along the tracks in summer

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,000
In both hands, their wish to take wing

46
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:42,170
We chased and chased vanishing vapor trails

47
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,050
Since the day we climbed over that hill

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,120
Unfailingly

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,820
And just like we have always

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,260
Stood straight and tall

51
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:06,400
We will stay as strong as the god of the sea

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,990
Surely

53
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,520
The girl said she wanted to see the ocean.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,820
But I couldn't take her.

55
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,150
Episode 7

56
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,070
Misuzu fainted?

57
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,140
Yeah, she hasn't been feeling well all day.

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,470
She's resting in her room.
Could you go check on her?

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,650
If she sees my drunken face,
she'll feel even worse.

60
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,640
Hey, I brought some sushi.
Let's enjoy it together.

61
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,790
That really hurt, you know.

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,330
Why did you take Misuzu in?

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,590
Huh?

64
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,330
Why did you take Misuzu in?

65
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,590
Oh, so she told you about that...

66
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,540
I didn't choose to take her in. I was forced into it.

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,810
I said I didn't want her.

68
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,910
That's why she can't lean on you.

69
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,350
Think about it! For her, you're her only parent!

70
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,980
She has an episode whenever
she gets friendly with someone.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,490
She and I never got emotionally close.

72
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,950
That's why this is working.

73
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,890
What is a family, I wonder...

74
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,300
I don't know because I'm not her real mom.

75
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,130
Ugh... This one isn't good.

76
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,980
The girl dreams. The first one is about the sky.

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,280
The dreams keep going back in time.

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,290
The dreams plague her.

79
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,360
She starts to feel pain for no reason.

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,760
Eventually, she starts to lose her memories.

81
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,600
She will even forget the one she loves most.

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,460
Extra Thick
Peach Nectar
She will even forget the one she loves most.

83
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,330
She will even forget the one she loves most.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,630
And in the morning after the final dream,
she will die.

85
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,710
She is always alone.

86
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,610
If she becomes attached to anyone,
both will fall ill.

87
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,940
Neither will survive.

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,880
So the girl told me, "Stay away from me."

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,350
She was a kind and strong girl.
That's why I survived.

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,620
But she...

91
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,590
There is a girl with wings in the sky.

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,430
She is always alone.

93
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,770
She perishes, never having a chance to grow up,

94
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,700
repeating such sad dreams over and over again.

95
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,510
You're going on a trip?!

96
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,810
Yeah, I thought I'd get away by myself,
visit some hot springs.

97
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,620
What are you thinking? What about Misuzu?

98
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,050
She's all yours!

99
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,790
If you don't get too close to her,
she should be all right.

100
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,090
Wait!

101
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,900
She's having dreams.
The dreams are doing this to her.

102
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,030
Huh?!

103
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,760
I remembered a story my mother told me.

104
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,970
My mother met a girl with the same
sickness a long time ago.

105
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,080
Misuzu will start to forget:
About me and about you.

106
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,750
And when she has her last dream,

107
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,510
she's probably going to die.

108
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,720
Now, listen...

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,420
There are jokes you can make,
and those you shouldn't.

110
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,790
It's not a joke! Misuzu is...

111
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,760
Move!

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,060
Hey!

113
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,020
I'm coming in.

114
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,530
Oh, you're up?

115
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, I just woke up.

116
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,500
I heard Mom's voice.

117
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,710
Yeah, she's going away for a while.

118
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,680
Oh, I see...

119
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,680
I love my mom.

120
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,220
Let's go to the ocean.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,460
We're not in any hurry, so take it easy.

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,830
Yeah.

123
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,960
Oh, a crow.

124
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,670
Misuzu!

125
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,240
Hey, are you all right?

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,980
Yeah...

127
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,910
I'm okay.

128
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,150
V.

129
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,820
I take this road all the time,

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,290
but I don't remember the ocean being so far.

131
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,960
What's wrong?

132
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,060
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,970
I... again...

134
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,610
You're having another attack?

135
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,730
I'm sorry...

136
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,310
I'll be all right soon.

137
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,010
We'll try the ocean tomorrow.

138
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,320
Are you all right now?

139
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,190
Yeah.

140
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,700
You know...

141
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,900
I had another dream last night.

142
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,400
This one was a happy one.

143
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
The night sky was really bright.

144
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,170
I think it was a festival.

145
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,540
I was watching it from afar.

146
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,280
I see.

147
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,580
Hey, Yukito...

148
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,380
What is it?

149
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,520
There's a connection between the person
you're looking for and my dreams, isn't there?

150
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,110
I don't know... Probably not.

151
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,030
I thought about this a lot, and
I think I know the answer.

152
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,730
Would you listen to me?

153
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,300
It's another me in my dreams.

154
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,930
And she's suffering now.

155
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm going to try to see more dreams.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,740
Because they might help me understand.

157
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,370
Then, maybe I can help her.

158
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,350
Yukito, it's not a coincidence that
I started having dreams, is it?

159
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,860
I thought this summer was special.

160
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,590
I wanted to try to make friends.

161
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,200
Then, I met you and started having the dreams.

162
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,890
I think they're all connected, don't you think?

163
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,630
So, I want to do my best,

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,640
because I want to make
this summer the best one.

165
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,610
Because it's the summer I met you.

166
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,170
Hey.

167
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm okay now. I feel much better.

168
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,310
Misuzu!

169
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,060
Huh? I wonder what's wrong?

170
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,190
My legs won't move.

171
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,880
Maybe we should call Hijiri.

172
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,180
Or should I take you to a hospital?

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,350
No, I don't think a doctor can fix me.

174
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,010
You know it, right?

175
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,460
That my dreams are making me this way.

176
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,820
Well...

177
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,230
I had another dream last night.
It was about a journey.

178
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,660
A journey?

179
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
I was looking for something.

180
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,300
I was walking through a forest
for days and days.

181
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
It was hard but I kept going.

182
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,340
I had someone special with me.

183
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,740
Someone special?

184
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,010
I know it. Every time I have a dream,
I get weaker.

185
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,780
And then, in the end I will be just like
the girl in the sky...

186
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,650
Stop it! That's not going to happen!

187
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,950
I got scolded.

188
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,390
Don't think about your other self.

189
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,980
First, you have to get better.

190
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,150
Yep. I'm a tough kid!

191
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,390
Yukito!

192
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,790
Yukito, Yukito!

193
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,120
What happened?

194
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,030
Nothing...

195
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,600
If nothing happened, your face
wouldn't look like that.

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
My face has always looked like this.

197
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,240
Misuzu, go back to bed.

198
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
I can't leave you here.

199
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,910
I'll be okay, really. Don't give me a hard time.

200
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,340
Okay...

201
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,780
What's with this scar?

202
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,530
It hurts!

203
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,430
Misuzu! Hang on!

204
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,160
Misuzu!

205
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll be all right.

206
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,380
I'll be better soon.
Please stay here with me.

207
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,310
But if I'm close to you...

208
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,880
I'll be okay. Please stay here...

209
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,880
Why does everyone leave me?

210
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,700
How are you feeling?

211
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,930
I'm okay now. How about you, Yukito?

212
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm fine.

213
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,510
What do you think?
Should I call Hijiri? Or Kano?

214
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,880
Minagi is out of town, so maybe
someone from your school...

215
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,050
No, that's okay. I don't want to bother anyone.

216
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,950
Don't lie. Don't you want friends?
You don't like being alone, do you?

217
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:31,020
I want you. As long as you're here,
I don't need anything.

218
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,590
Do you not like that?

219
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,830
Don't be silly.

220
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,700
I want to go to the ocean with you.

221
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,470
I want to play on the beach, run and
splash water at each other...

222
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,400
And then, in the end, tell each other,
"See you tomorrow..."

223
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,840
But I have to be patient now.

224
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,910
Then, it'll be even better when we
finally do get to go.

225
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,240
Hang in there, Misuzu!

226
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,980
Misuzu...

227
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,750
What?
Misuzu...

228
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,680
I think I should leave soon.

229
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,860
If I stay with you any longer,
neither one of us will survive.

230
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,030
So, I've decided to run away from you.

231
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,030
I'll leave this town and go somewhere
where I won't see you again.

232
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,200
By yourself?

233
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,830
Yeah, we got too close to each other.

234
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,950
Well, then, I guess that's how it has to be.
We have no choice, do we?

235
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,250
I should've played by myself like this all along.

236
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,240
Maybe...

237
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,620
I had a fun summer vacation...
a summer vacation with you.

238
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,560
I had fun, too.

239
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,570
Really?

240
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,060
Yeah.

241
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,500
There aren't any more buses today?

242
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,730
Yukito.

243
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,350
Um, my dream this morning.
I was locked up in a room alone.

244
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,450
I was sad.

245
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,920
I was waiting for someone to come
and take me out.

246
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,450
I... I want to go with you.
Can't I please go with you?

247
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,230
It's not that I want to leave this house.

248
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,290
I just have to stay away from you.

249
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,770
If I'm away from you, you'll heal.

250
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,210
So, that's why I can't be with you.

251
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,740
Yeah, I see. I understand.

252
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,050
I'm sorry I said such stupid things.

253
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,640
No...

254
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,320
Then, bye-bye. Take care.

255
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,220
You, too. Stay strong.

256
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,190
Stay strong, even if you're alone.

257
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,390
Yes, I'll stay strong even if I'm alone.

258
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,060
I'm a tough kid.

259
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,530
That's my girl. Bye, now.

260
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,200
Misuzu...

261
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,230
What are you thinking now, Yukito?

262
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,200
Do you want your audience to laugh?

263
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,700
Otherwise, they won't move.

264
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,370
Ocean Taxi Ferry Depot
Otherwise, they won't move.

265
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,900
Ocean Taxi Ferry Depot
Just wishing for them to move isn't enough;
you have to reach further.

266
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,340
Just wishing for them to move isn't enough;
you have to reach further.

267
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,100
Then, and only then,
will the puppet move for you.

268
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,780
You did it!

269
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,120
The girl said she wanted to see the ocean.

270
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,360
But I couldn't take her.

271
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,660
Yukito, I want you to save her this time for sure.

272
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,840
There is a wish that was never granted,
here in this puppet.

273
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,370
My mother, and her mother before her,

274
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,830
managed to put their power into this puppet
before they perished.

275
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,770
For the day someone is ready
to release her wish...

276
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,620
So, I want to become one of the wishes.

277
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,590
How you use it is up to you.

278
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,580
You can forget about the girl in the sky.

279
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:34,390
But Yukito, you are sure
to meet a girl somewhere.

280
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,140
If you really feel that you want to help her,

281
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,910
then, put your heart and soul into the puppet.

282
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,810
Because I will be with you.

283
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,140
Put my heart and soul into the puppet?

284
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,480
There's something wrong with this guy.

285
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,750
Maybe he got sick in this heat.

286
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,720
Let me go!

287
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,370
Please, help me.

288
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,330
What?

289
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,810
I want you to watch the show and tell me what
I can do to make it fun, make people laugh.

290
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,210
Wow, cool!

291
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,780
Strange!

292
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,270
But it's not all that funny, is it?

293
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,280
You should do more instead of
just making it walk.

294
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,110
Make it like a story.

295
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,990
Like, make it dance.

296
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,360
D-Dance?

297
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,090
It has to be more original.

298
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,160
Wow!

299
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,980
Extra Thick
Peach Nectar

300
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,480
That was funny!

301
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,550
It was funny and cute!

302
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,350
Okay. Thanks a lot for staying this long.

303
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,690
Then good luck, Mister!

304
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,060
Bye now!

305
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,970
Misuzu, I'm back.

306
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,910
I won't go anywhere.

307
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,680
I'll stay with you and I'll make you laugh.

308
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,690
Yukito...

309
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,060
I learned the trick. It'll be really funny for sure.

310
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,110
So, pay close attention.

311
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,150
Misuzu!

312
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,370
Misuzu!

313
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,930
Watch this! Please laugh!

314
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,080
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

315
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,820
All I needed to do to be happy was
to be here with you, and watch you laugh.

316
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,820
If I'd done that, I would've been happy.

317
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,190
I'll never go anywhere.

318
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,260
Stay with me and keep smiling.

319
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,780
Okay? Misuzu?

320
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,200
Yukito, remember now what it is
that you need to do.

321
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,900
I... I want to be with Misuzu.

322
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,710
I want to do it all over, if I can,
from back when I first met her.

323
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,310
Then, this time, I'll stay with her...

324
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,690
Why?

325
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,490
I thought I wouldn't be able to get up anymore...

326
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,470
Yukito? Where are you?

327
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,100
You came back for me, didn't you?

328
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,740
Hey, I got better. I think I'll be okay.

329
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,110
Hey, Yukito?

330
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,360
Shoryaku 5

331
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Ouch...

332
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,300
You, what are you doing in such a place?

333
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,370
If you have time to talk, get off of me!

334
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,470
You are not from here, are you?

335
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,840
I am Ryuya, Senior Assistant Lieutenant
of the Outer Palace Guard.

336
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,980
What about you? Where in the world
did you come from?

337
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,080
You don't know my name?

338
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,640
No. We just met.

339
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,860
I see. I guess I'm not that well-known.

340
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,990
I am Kanna.

341
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,690
That's a strange coincidence.

342
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,700
The winged person who ordered me to
become a guard... her name is Kanna, too.

343
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,800
Oh... It certainly is a strange coincidence.

344
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,290
That's for sure.

345
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,560
How rude!

346
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,720
Catching hold of the remnant

347
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,020
Of a dream that fades to white

348
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,790
The young boy runs

349
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,040
When he lets go

350
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,270
It vanishes forever with

351
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,050
The cry of the wind

352
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:55,680
A gentleness, once so apparent, is now gone

353
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:06,860
My eyes remain on the steps my feet take

354
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:15,610
Hearing forever the sounds of singing

355
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,250
That had faded away by morning

356
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:37,660

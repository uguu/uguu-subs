00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,310
Sir Ryuya...

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,140
What is it?

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,860
I have a favor to ask of you.

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,830
I am a little embarrassed, but...
would you look?

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,700

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,460
Now then, here I go...

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,460
Just a minute!

20
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,140
What are those?

21
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,910
Can you not see? They are beanbags.

22
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,040
What are you going to do now?

23
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,480
I told you, these are beanbags!

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,670
I was able to throw three earlier!

25
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,040
Part 2

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,220
Your eyes say that you do not believe me.

27
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,350
It is true! It is true that I was able
to throw three beautifully!

28
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,160
Good night.

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,260
Do not go back to sleep!
Good night.

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,660
Do not go back to sleep!

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,760
Go back to bed. I'm on watch here.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,330
Your Mistress is offering to show you
her hard-acquired skills!

33
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,130
It is the duty of a retainer to
respectfully observe!

34
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,440
Don't be so unreasonable!

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,470
Then, I will order you!

36
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,310
Wait, wait, wait!

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,810
It's not fair to use your authority as a
superior in a time like this!

38
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,840
I can't stand to take any more pointless oaths!

39
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,550
Ouch! Ouch, ouch!

40
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,290
Stop biting me all the time!

41
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,520
That is because you were so rough!

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,100
Fine then. I'll watch you, but make it quick.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,670
I do not like the way you said that!

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,740
Okay, okay! I want to see it!
I do not like the way you said that!

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,630
Okay, okay! I want to see it!

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,010
I would love to see it,
so please do it right away!

47
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,770
As usual, your words are not sincere.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,680
Well, it is okay.

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,910
When you see my skill,
you will change your attitude.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,040
I finally got the trick.

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,860
Now that I have mastered it,
it is not anything difficult.

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,290
Now I am as skilled a
beanbag thrower as Uraha.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,060
Uh-huh...

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,800
I now understand the importance of
striving toward something.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,770
Uh-huh...

56
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,000
Behold!

57
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,510
That was a mistake.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,300
I am not lying. I really did do it.

59
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,780
Nobody said you lied.

60
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,210
I'm watching. Do it as many times as you want.

61
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,980
This time for sure...

62
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,680
Relax your shoulders.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,620
Even a master can't do it well if she's not calm.

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,210
Y-you are right.

65
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,890
Here I go.

66
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,650
See, see? I am doing it!

67
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,070
That was impressive!

68
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,170
I do not need consolation.

69
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,510
It's not consolation.

70
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,040
You reached this level because
you made the effort.

71
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,880
It's amazing when a person
doesn't know when to give up.

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,320
I am not sure whether that is
a compliment or not...

73
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,250
It's a compliment.

74
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,250
Either way, good work, Kanna.

75
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,290
I want to get even better.

76
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,530
If you keep practicing every day,
I'm sure you'll become a master.

77
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,960
You exaggerate...

78
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,430
It's true.

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,060
Will you watch me again, sometime?

80
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,970
Yes, if I may.

81
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,610
Get a little sleep now while you can.
We have a long walk ahead of us again today.

82
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,970
Yeah.

83
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,530
We're going to have to go over
these mountains...

84
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,900
Going through the mountains is the
surest way to evade our pursuers.

85
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,330
I will go fetch some water for us.

86
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,140
What is wrong, Kanna?

87
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,720
Ow!

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,990
Forgive me...

89
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,450
I can't, I can't take any more...

90
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,600
Forgive me...

91
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,290
I can't... Not anymore...

92
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,530
I can't eat any more...

93
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,810
Hey, you're gonna catch a cold,
sleeping like that!

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,520
Hey, don't go back to sleep!

95
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,870
Don't go back to sleep
for the third time either!

96
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,490
Sir Ryuya, you are too easy on her.

97
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,150
That hurt. What do you think you are doing?

98
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,790
Lady Kanna, I trust you are feeling well today.

99
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,620
Do I look like I am feeling well?

100
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,190
Can you not wake me up a little more gently?

101
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,690
Then, the next time, I will adjust my force.

102
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,890
I am telling you not to
pull my pillow out from under me!

103
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,540
You have strange ears.

104
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,850
Do they not get caught in branches
when you run?

105
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,310
With those long ears, you must be able
to hear sounds from pretty far.

106
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,080
You! Are you teasing me?

107
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,730
Wait up! Wait, I tell you!

108
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,600
Hey, wait up! Wait, wait, wait!

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,570
Be quiet!
Hey, wait up! Wait, wait, wait!

110
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:06,860
Be quiet!

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,660
Settle down a minute!

112
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,570
What have you been looking at?

113
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,870
It's a map I found at the market earlier.

114
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,540
It's a lucky find!

115
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,050
What are these wriggly marks like worms?

116
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,510
They're the names of rivers.

117
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,080
Kanna, you can't read?

118
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,020
Nobody taught me.
How is it possible that I can read?

119
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,060
I can't believe Uraha neglected you.

120
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
I did not neglect her.

121
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,700
Lady Kanna told me that she would
never learn to read, not from ME.

122
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,770
That was your fault.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,270
I will not let you pretend that you do not
remember those poetry books.

124
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,010
I was only trying to enrich your mind.

125
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,980
How do you expect to enrich my mind
with that teaching method?

126
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,470
What are you talking about?

127
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,550
I was teaching her poems.

128
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,620
You know how there is a bit of hardship
in learning anything...

129
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,180
But Lady Kanna was...

130
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,860
Memorizing one hundred poems in one day
is hardly a BIT of hardship!

131
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,090
You could not take too much time,
as the books contained 4,500 poems in all.

132
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,290
I have not slept in five days.

133
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,160
You must endure until you've memorized
two hundred more.

134
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm surprised that you didn't die.

135
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,880
Yes, exactly.

136
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
I thought I would end up being killed
if I didn't do something.

137
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,750
So, I threw all my poetry books
into the furnace.

138
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,520
With that, the six precious volumes
of our ancient poetry collection

139
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,490
became fuel for our breakfast.

140
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,950
Breakfast that morning was poetically tasty.

141
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,730
Is it this mouth that speaks such crude words?!

142
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,600
S-Stop it, Uraha.

143
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,470
A mouth that cannot recite a single poem
is a useless possession!

144
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,940
Do not he so irrational!

145
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,400
Shall we sew it shut?!
Do not he so irrational!

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,470
Shall we sew it shut?!

147
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,500
What are you doing? Help her quickly!

148
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,150
But, even I'm afraid of Uraha, too.

149
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,010
You! How useless you are!

150
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,660
I am so sorry. I lost control of myself!

151
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,490
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

152
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,330
Why are you forgetting her?

153
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,790
You still sound funny.

154
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,190
Enough!

155
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,000
I am going to go over there and
practice my beanbag throwing.

156
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,370
Staying here any longer will make me irritable.

157
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,200
Then, I will come with you.

158
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,040
There is no need for that!

159
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,350
Why are you hitting ME?

160
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,910
I am taking it out on you!

161
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,590
Kanna! What happened?

162
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,810
A monk... is he not?

163
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,110
He doesn't have any external wounds.
He must've collapsed here.

164
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,630
Sir Ryuya.

165
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,430
May I interrupt?

166
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,600
What? Beanbags again?

167
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,500
No, it is not.

168
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,770
You have something on your mind, do you not?

169
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,610
Something on my mind?

170
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,580
Yes. If you want to say something,
don't keep it inside. Speak up.

171
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,980
Something I want to say...

172
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,420
Then let me say one thing.

173
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,080
Yes, what is it?

174
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,120
There's a worm on top of your head.

175
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,170
You must be the type
beasts and worms are fond of.

176
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,770
Don't just sit there calmly! Help me!

177
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,710
I sensed that something
might be wrong with you.

178
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,730
I, your Mistress, was worried about you,
her retainer, and this is what comes of it?

179
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,910
I'm sorry. I'll tell you the truth, so stay.

180
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,150
You are not going to tease me again, are you?

181
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,290
It's a silly story. Do you really want to hear it?

182
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,050
Tell me anything.

183
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,360
I don't know my parents' faces.

184
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,060
Why ever not?

185
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,330
I think I was abandoned.

186
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,990
Unsui picked me up when
I was crying on the roadside.

187
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,330
Unsui was a traveling monk.

188
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,540
"Traveling monk" sounds nice and all,

189
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,640
but in actuality, he was a homeless monk
who survived on handouts.

190
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,180
The two of us traveled to
many places together.

191
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,350
We went north, south, east and west.

192
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,460
Was he your foster parent, Sir Ryuya?

193
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,690
I wouldn't call him that.

194
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,530
He was very strict.

195
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,190
Unless he was chanting prayers,
he didn't waste his breath.

196
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,460
He never even told me his priesthood name.

197
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,970
It was the summer when
I was about five years old.

198
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,780
We were attacked by villains
while going over a mountain pass.

199
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,410
Unsui was killed with one swing of a sword.

200
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,480
Seeing that monk earlier
brought back that memory.

201
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,990
You had no mother either, Sir Ryuya?

202
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,160
Huh?

203
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,120
Then, it does not seem fair that
only I will meet my mother.

204
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,270
Don't worry about that.
I want you to meet her, too.

205
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,110
Unsui was still chanting a prayer
even after he was slashed,

206
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,380
praying that the killer would be saved
and enter the Pure Land...

207
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,340
even while he was dying,
covered in his own blood.

208
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,590
They didn't kill me.

209
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,150
They told me I wasn't worth
soiling their swords.

210
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,000
Then, I was alone on the roadside once again.

211
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,670
After that, I was alone for a long time.

212
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,900
I did anything necessary to survive.

213
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,180
I stole swords and spears,
and took part in battles.

214
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,050
I even killed people.

215
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,010
Survival was the only thing on my mind.

216
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,620
Until recently, that is.

217
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,350
Recently? Did something happen?

218
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,960
It's called a change of heart.

219
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,720
Humans can change, if given the chance.

220
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,700
I imagine the villains regret what they did.

221
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,830
Huh?

222
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,770
It is natural to feel regret
after killing an admirable priest.

223
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,280
I really doubt he was an admirable priest.

224
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,550
Why do you doubt it?

225
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:06,680
Because his prayer was heard, the villains
did not kill you. Is that not so?

226
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,490
I see.

227
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,690
True enough, it might have been Unsui
who saved me back then.

228
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,230
I wish I'd realized that sooner.

229
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,040
Then I definitely would've taken a different path.

230
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,940
That is not good.

231
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,140
If you had, I would not have met you.

232
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,510
That's true. I'm glad that I met you, too.

233
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,840
Sir Ryuya.

234
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Sir Ryuya... Uh...

235
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,660
Uh, well...

236
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,890
What is it?

237
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,690
I am not sure where we go from here.

238
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,140
So, I will leave the rest up to you.

239
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,500
H-Hey!

240
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,550
I am embarrassed. Hurry up!

241
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,290
Um, do you really understand
what's going to happen to you?

242
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,430
D-do not make a fool of me.
I know everything.

243
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,760
Uraha told me.

244
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,960
I knew it was Uraha's doing.

245
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,070
Well... you are... To me...

246
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,470
I do not know how to say it, but... it's like...

247
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,040
Uraha told me this.

248
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,810
When the time comes that Ryuya starts to tell
you about his past, do not miss the opportunity.

249
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,820
A man inevitably tells the woman
he loves about his past.

250
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,190
She said so.

251
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,350
She read my actions...

252
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,990
"When Sir Ryuya finishes his story,
loosen your clothing casually."

253
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,630
"It is important, though, not to expose
your breasts completely..."

254
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,500
It came with acting lessons, too?

255
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,540
Did I miss something?

256
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,410
Sir Ryuya, do you, by any chance, prefer men?

257
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,780
Hold it right there.

258
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,250
Oh, I understand now!

259
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,720
Even among straight men,
there are a few useless ones...

260
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,590
Don't go around smearing my good name!

261
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,830
Maybe I got undressed too far?

262
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,590
Alright, I got it.

263
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,100
I will show you that I am a man.
Prepare yourself.

264
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,700
Sir Ryuya, you have
a strange look in your eye!

265
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
You're the one who seduced me.

266
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,940
Now be a good girl and take my venom.

267
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,410
You have venom?

268
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,040
All men have venom. We have a lot of
things you don't even know about.

269
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,280
I'll take you by the hand and
teach you EVERYTHING.

270
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,080
Hey! Stop! Stop it!

271
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,550
Stop it!

272
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,520
Uraha! I know you're hiding
around here somewhere! Come out!

273
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,260
As usual, your intuition is good.

274
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,640
Lady Kanna, are you all right?

275
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,010
I am not sure, but it seems it did not go well.

276
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,070
Sir Ryuya!

277
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,320
Did I anger you?

278
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,720
No, I'm not angry.

279
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,460
Uraha, you knew I would
never touch her, didn't you?

280
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,060
I know it was not a very good bet, but...

281
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,900
You'll never find a more harmless man than me.

282
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,170
That is also called being useless.

283
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,800
Oh shut up!

284
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,780
She's sleeping well.

285
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,620
Because she worked hard again today
on her beanbag juggling.

286
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,920
She looks pretty cute when she's sleeping.

287
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,760
We must teach her about men,
before a no-good worm gets to her.

288
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,750
What am I, training material for her?

289
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,920
She's still a child. She hasn't even
played with dolls or beanbags.

290
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,530
Mother...

291
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,640
Are you awake?

292
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,080
I was dreaming.

293
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,680
It was not here. It was somewhere else.

294
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,140
I was wearing something strange,
and I looked different.

295
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,750
Was it really me?

296
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,590
What did you look like?

297
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,530
I do not remember so well.

298
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,930
But Mother and other kind people
were around me.

299
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,600
I was very happy.

300
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,380
It was a good dream, then.

301
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,250
You can turn it into reality.

302
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,980
You'll meet your mother soon.

303
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,520
Then, your dream won't be a dream anymore.

304
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,250
Yes, you are right.

305
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,590
If I pray, I am sure that my wish
will reach the heavens.

306
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,560
Look, look! I am doing it! It's going!

307
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,300
It's still going!

308
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,190
It looks like you need a little more training.

309
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,600
But that was wonderfully done, Lady Kanna.

310
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,000
If you keep training like this,
you will become even better.

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,970
Really? Will I become good enough
to show Mother?

312
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,770
Of course!

313
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,710
It's about time to get going, Kanna.

314
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,120
What is wrong? Do you not want
to come with us?

315
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,500
Is that your mother?

316
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,470
I am happy for you.

317
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,780
I wish you a long, happy life.

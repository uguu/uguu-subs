00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,760
Then I would rather... with my own hands...

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,790
Hey, Kano!

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,030
Misuzu! Kano!

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,300
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,420
Kieru hikoukigumo bokutachi wa miokutta
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,650
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,050
We ran away because it was so bright

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:52,830
There are still unreachable places in the distance

Todokanai basho ga mada tooku ni aru
There are still unreachable places in the distance

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,340
There are still unreachable places in the distance

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,810

00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,210

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,510
The children walk along the summer railways

Kodomotachi wa natsu no senro aruku
The children walk along the summer railways

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,730

Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:22,470
We've been chasing and chasing after the disappearing vapor trails

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,300
Looks like you might have this bruise for a while.

42
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,800
I apologize for the trouble.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm sorry, Kunisaki-kun, Kamio-san.

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,280
Oh, not at all.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,510
It's not really us I'm worried about.

46
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,980
It goes back to when Kano was still a little girl.

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,500
episode four

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,240
It was the first summer after our mother died.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Look, Onee-chan! Balloons!

50
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,880
<b>BALLOONS</b>

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,890
Over there! If we bought one, do you think we could fly?

Over there! If we bought one, do you think we could fly?

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,600
If one balloon could lift up a person,

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,860
the shop would've flown away by now.

56
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,820
I see.

57
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,850
Onee-chan, you are so smart!

58
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,790
But then, that means we can fly if we have many balloons, right?

59
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,830
Well, maybe you could fly if you had a lot.

60
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,620
But I can only buy you one.

61
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,660
We just have to blow it up really big!

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,780
Then, it can lift up something a lot heavier.

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,750
We won't be able to buy anything else.

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,310
Okay!

65
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,470
There.

66
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,500
Oh, thank you, Onee-chan!

67
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,150
Kano had wanted to fly.

68
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,730
She thought she could see our mother that way.

69
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,850
I taught her that our mother was in the sky and watching us.

70
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,650
Neither our father nor I could tell her,

71
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,620
that her mother was no longer around anywhere.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,340
Kano!

73
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,630
Then, what happened?

74
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,130
Nothing. Nothing happened.

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,590
Who's playing over there?

76
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,810
We put the plume back and went home.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,450
I guess we can't go to where Mom is anymore.

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,950
The following morning, Kano started acting strangely.

79
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,460
She became afraid of bright lights,

80
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,560
and she started wandering around in a daze and talking to herself,

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
saying things that didn't make any sense.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,890
One evening, I noticed that she was gone.

83
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:30,900
I rushed to find her, and when I did, she was in this examination room, with a scalpel to her wrist.
One evening, I noticed that she was gone.

84
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,070
I rushed to find her, and when I did, she was in this examination room, with a scalpel to her wrist.

85
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,540
I caught her in time,

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,920
so I was able to stop her before things got too serious,

87
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,690
but I realized then that she wasn't Kano.

88
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,500
Someone else was pretending to be her.

89
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,930
Is it multiple personality?

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,230
It could be.

91
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,920
<i>This is a magical bandana.</i>

92
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,780
<i>If you wear it until you grow up, you will be given magical powers; so don't ever take it off.</i>

93
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,360
If yo<i>u wear it until you grow up, you will be given magical powers; so don't ever take it off.</i>

94
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,830
I see. You were the one who gave her the bandana.

95
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,440
If she tried to cut her wrist again unconsciously,

96
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,850
I had thought that the bandana would snap her back into reality.

97
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,090
I doubt that Kano remembers much about it.

98
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,440
There never was any such thing as magic.

99
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,610
I decided to follow in my father's footsteps.

100
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,120
I thought if I became a doctor, I'd be able to heal Kano's illness one day.

101
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,650
What kind of thing was that plume that Kano touched?

102
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,160
I don't know.

103
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,440
Seems like it's been there at the shrine since the olden days.

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,990
I heard that even the shrine keeper doesn't know the details.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,370
Maybe it's the plume's curse.

106
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,590
As a doctor, I can't accept that kind of reasoning.

107
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,300
It's possible that it acted as a psychological trigger for her illness.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,140
Kano was suffering severe stress after losing her mother.

109
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,750
I believe that is the root cause of her illness.

110
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,830
Will you visit Kirishima-san again today?

111
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,940
Yeah, I have work there anyway.

112
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,000
Maybe I will go visit Kano later too.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,640
You should. I am glad that you made a new friend.

114
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,190
I had a dream again last night.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
A dream about flying.

116
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,870
I've been going further and further back in time in my dreams.

117
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,590
Last night, I was mourning in the sky.

118
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,340
Mourning?

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,970
As usual, my body was flying through the sky.

120
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,780
And I was mourning there.

121
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:53,150
I wonder why I was feeling so sad, in the middle of such beautiful and comfortable breezes.

122
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,600
It was only a dream. It has nothing to do with you personally.

123
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,190
Right.

124
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,810
When you're not smiling, I also feel...

125
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,280
Huh?

126
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,990
Anyway, keep smiling.

127
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,500
There's nothing here...

128
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,470
I found it!

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,940
What are you doing?

130
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,010
Kunisaki Yukito! What are you doing here?

131
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,880
That's my line!

132
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,770
Picking up stuff like that... What are you, a garbage collector?

133
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,860
How bothersome!

134
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,030
It's my hobby to find interesting things at places like this.

135
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,040
That's the shabbiest hobby in the world!
It's my hobby to find interesting things at places like this.

136
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,720
That's the shabbiest hobby in the world!

137
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
Leave me alone!

138
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,610
Anyway, you play day in day out. I envy you.

139
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,130
Kunisaki Yukito, you're doing almost the same thing, aren't you?

140
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,410
I work like a decent person.

141
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,860
In fact, I'm on my way to work diligently at my job as we speak.

142
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,350
You need a pit stop?

143
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,770
No. Look over there.

144
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,430
That's...

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,340
By any chance, is that Minagi's mom?

146
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,770
What's wrong?

147
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,070
Umm, nothing.

148
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,040
Minagi looks sad.

149
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,010
Hey, call Minagi over.

150
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,000
I bet she's lonely all by herself.

151
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,460
You're right. I'll give it a shot.

152
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,970
Tohno!

153
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,730
Kunisaki-san. What are you doing here?

154
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,700
Oh, I was just taking a walk with Michiru.

155
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,160
Sakuma Cycling Shop

156
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,980
Where did she go?

157
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,000

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,530
Were you with Michiru?

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,450
Yeah, I <i>was</i> with her, but...

Sakuma Cycling Shop

162
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,930
Did she say anything about the person who was just with me?

Sakuma Cycling Shop

164
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,810
No, she didn't say anything in particular.

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,480
I see. Then, that's okay.

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,430
That woman... she's your mother, right?
Sakuma Cycling Shop

168
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,830
That woman... she's your mother, right?

169
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,850
I once helped her with a big load.

170
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,410
Now that I think about it, you two do give off a similar aura.

171
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,900
I am a fragment of her dream.

172
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,880
Huh?

173
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,480
Don't run away, Potato.

174
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,440
This will cool you off!

175
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,830
You're looking well.

176
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,670
Oh, Yukito-kun. Good morning.

177
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:00,680
I'm sorry for causing you trouble again last night.
Oh, Yukito-kun. Good morning.

178
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,830
I'm sorry for causing you trouble again last night.

179
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,660
Not a big deal. Don't worry.

180
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,730
Oh, there you are, Kunisaki-kun. As usual, I have a lot for you to do today.

181
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,780
Is Kano-san taking a nap?

182
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,720
Yeah, I told her to rest. Especially because of last night.

183
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,740
She should be waking up soon.

184
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,450
I'll go check on her.

185
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,860
Kano?

186
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,210
Huh?

187
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,750
<i>Yukito-kun, I am writing this to you because I think you will believe me.</i>

188
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,620
<i>I've decided to go to the skies after all.</i>

189
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,410
<i>I feel that this will allow everyone to be happy.</i>

190
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,470
<i>I have a feeling that I will be able to meet the person you are looking for too.</i>

191
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,560
<i>I don't know how long it will take, but I will bring her back with me.</i>

192
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,990
<i>It would make me happy if you helped out Big Sis until then.</i>

193
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,730
<i>She may not look it, but she's been under a lot of stress.</i>

194
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,540
<i><b>P.S.</b> I am really sorry about the bruise on your neck.</i>

195
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,680
Kano!

196
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,650
Wake up! Kano!

197
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,980
There are no external wounds.

198
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,000
Then, this blood is...

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,610
There's no sign of blood loss.

200
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,090
It doesn't seem to be life threatening.

201
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,840
What in the world happened?

202
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,190
I wonder if she tried to go up to the sky from here.

203
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,140
What's this?

204
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,410
Is something wrong, Yukito-san?

205
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:20,060
I feel a chill... sort of nostalgic, and sort of melancholic.

206
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,360
Lay Kano down.

207
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,650
Kunisaki-kun...

208
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,250
<i>My name is Shiraho.</i>

209
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,710
<i>Please listen to my story.</i>

210
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,180
<i>I remember it was a beautiful autumn.</i>

211
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,990
<i>My husband and I had our first child.</i>

212
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,270
<i>She had a birthmark on her right wrist.</i>

213
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,770
<i>The villagers said it was bad karma, but we didn't worry about it.</i>

214
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,670
<i>When Yakumo cried, I would sing a lullaby that I learned from my mother.</i>

215
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,710
<i>Usually, she'd stop crying, but that day, she didn't.</i>

216
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,630
<i>I was sure that the plume was a god-sent charm for her.</i>

217
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,310
Take them away!

218
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,770
<i>A war broke out and my husband never returned.</i>

219
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,400
Is there anyone in this village who picked up a shining plume?

220
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,170
It is cursed! Anyone who touched it should step forward!

221
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,380
<i>I ran away from the village that night.</i>

222
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,350
<i>And finally, I arrived at this village.</i>

223
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,250
<i>The priest was very kind to us outsiders.</i>

224
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:56,480
<i>I was sure that Yakumo and I would be able to start a new life in this peaceful village.</i>

225
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,090
<i>But...</i>

226
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,160
<i>That summer, a contagion spread through the village,</i>

227
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,140
<i>and many people died.</i>

228
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,950
How is she, sir?

229
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,810
She is over the worst. The fever should break soon.

230
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,900
However, the villagers believe that the two of you brought the plague to this village.

231
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh no!

232
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,760
It was my mistake to take you in.

233
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,720
The villagers worship an idol at this shrine.

234
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,950
The idol marks the one who brings bad fortune.

235
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,350
If they discover her birthmark,

236
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,730
they will demand her for a sacrificial offering.

237
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,210
Are you telling me to offer her for a living sacrifice?!

238
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,400
In this land,

239
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,040
we have always contained natural disasters by doing so.

240
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,010
She is my life!

241
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,690
She is the only treasure my husband left for me!

242
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,020
Give her up!

243
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,160
Otherwise, you will be killed as well.

244
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,390
Then I would rather do it with my own hands...

245
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,800
I can't do it. I can't do it!

246
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,390
What mother could kill her own child?

247
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,480
Even if that child might destroy the world, what mother could kill her own child?

248
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,910
I will sacrifice myself.

249
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,670
Please save her, please save my child.

250
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,530
Don't do it!

251
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,490
Mom?

252
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,560
Where are you, Mom?

253
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,890
<i>I am right here.</i>

254
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,040
Mom!

255
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,410
<i>Is there anything you want to eat?</i>

256
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,410
Nope, I'm full!

257
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,140
<i>Is there anything you want?</i>

258
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,860
Uh-uh.

259
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,180
Umm, I'm going home now.

260
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,280
Onee-chan is waiting for me. And Potato as well.

261
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,720
And my new friend.

262
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,680
<i>I see.</i>

263
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,760
He's looking for a girl in the sky.

264
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,840
I kind of wished that I was her.

265
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,240
<i>If things are too hard for you, you can come with me.</i>

266
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,790
Umm, Mom,

267
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,450
Thank you.

268
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,980
I don't remember very much about you, and...

269
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,190
It was probably because of me that you died so young.

270
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,710
But!

271
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,330
Thank you for giving birth to me!

272
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,720
I just wanted to say that.

273
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,320
<i>Kano, you don't have wings, so live happily there.</i>

274
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,850
Limitless are the ways this child is dear
Kono ko no kawaisa kagirinaya
<i>Kano, you don't have wings, so live happily there.</i>

275
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,320
Kono ko no kawaisa kagirinaya
Limitless are the ways this child is dear

276
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:40,000
The number of stars in the heavens
Ten ni tatoeba hoshi no kazu

277
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:49,640
The number of trees in the mountains and the eulalia grasses
Yama dewa ki no kazu, kaya no kazu

278
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:59,540
Flowering eulalia, bush clover, and bellflowers
Obana karukaya, hagi, kikyou

279
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:08,390
More precious than all the flowers of autumn
Nana kusa, chigusa no kazu yorimo

280
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:18,010
Is my sleeping child
Daijina kono ko ga nenne suru

281
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,640
What was that?

282
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,380
You saw it too, Kamio-san?

283
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,960
Yes.

284
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,450
Are you awake?

285
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,450
Kano!

286
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,320
Yukito-kun...

287
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,950
Onee-chan...

288
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,670
Kano!

289
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,320
What was that plume, anyway?

290
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,250
I don't know.

291
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,620
Onee-chan, I saw Mom.

292
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,350
Yeah, I was watching.

293
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:28,490
I couldn't go with her, but I was able to say thank you to her, just like Yukito-kun told me.

294
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,180
I have to thank you, Yukito-kun.

295
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,200
No, don't thank me.

296
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,610
That was your magic.

297
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,240
Yeah.

298
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,690
Let's let it float up to her in the sky.

299
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,530
Yeah!

300
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:18,980
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

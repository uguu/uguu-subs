1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,620
Why?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,080
Why must we leave the mountain?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,290
Forgive me, but I am Lady Kanna's attendant.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,790
I cannot go against her wishes.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,190
What are your intentions with me?

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,800
We will take you away from here.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,990
Then you will live happily ever after
with Lady Kanna.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,970
Our fate might have been different,
if there were more people like you.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,770
Please stand back!

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:32,650
Mother!

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:32,980
Stay back!
Mother!

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,040
Stay back!

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,350
My body has been defiled.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,810
Defiled?

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,740
You must not approach me.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,290
Mother...

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,860
We watched the vapor trails

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,700
As they disappeared

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,700
We ran from the blinding light

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:06,100
In vexation we let go

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,080
There are still places she cannot reach

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,330
She gazes with wistful eyes

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,670
Children walk along the tracks in summer

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,010
In both hands, their wish to take wing

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,180
We chased and chased vanishing vapor trails

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,060
Since the day we climbed over that hill

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,130
Unfailingly

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,830
And just like we have always

29
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,260
Stood straight and tall

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:08,410
We will stay as strong as the god of the sea

31
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,000
Surely

32
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,810
Episode 9

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,150
Did you say you are called Uraha?

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,760
Are you the one who found a way
through the joining boundary,

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,500
and discovered an escape route?

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,160
Yes, it was as if something led me...

37
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,740
You seem to have special powers.

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,070
Powers?

39
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,230
Quiet!

40
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,810
Is it a bird?

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,940
It is an arrow.

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,440
It signals the beginning of a war.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,940
Some army is attempting to invade
this sacred mountain.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,010
Down!

45
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,720
Mother!

46
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,190
I got her!

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,660
What?! My arrow got her first!

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,740
Don't look!

49
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,750
So this is the power of a winged person?

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,120
Mother!

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,360
Do not remove the arrows!

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,980
What are you saying?

53
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,850
She will only bleed to death.

54
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,790
Mother...

55
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,930
Do not touch me...

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,240
No!

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,900
No, no, no!

58
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,270
Lady Kanna!
Kanna!

59
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,170
Mother, mother!

60
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,540
Kanna... What a disobedient child you are.
I told you so many times.

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,850
Mother...

62
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,480
Ah, I had forgotten...
that a human's touch is so warm...

63
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,680
If this is my fate...

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,130
Kanna, listen carefully.

65
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,830
The ancient prayer was
supposed to perish with me,

66
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,160
but I will bestow it upon you now.

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,170
I wanted you to live as a normal girl if possible,

68
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,240
without the burden of a winged person.

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,570
Mother...

70
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,240
Strength...

71
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,380
Wind...

72
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,550
Ours... now...

73
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,520
We inherit a dream...

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,260
That the planet sees...

75
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,550
"A dream that the planet sees"?
What does that mean?

76
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,700
Ask... the way...

77
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:55,200
Everlasting... wings... and spirit...

78
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,950
That... is all.

79
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,450
Please forgive me. This truly is our duty.

80
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,950
Mother...

81
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,320
Now, Kanna. It is your turn.

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
How has your journey been?

83
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,360
Is it all right for you to be talking?

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,660
I lived in a shrine deep in
the forest till recently...

85
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,480
...I had never had such a happy trip
as this one before.

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,110
I have Ryuya and Uraha to thank for that.

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,520
Lady Kanna, your mother appears to be tired.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,390
Do you not have something
you wish to show her?

89
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,760
I have trained long and hard
in order to show you when we met.

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,570
I really, really can do it.
I will throw the next one well.

91
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,110
This time, for sure!

92
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,860
The next one. The next one will be good.

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,860
Why do they not perform?

94
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,830
Why do they not perform for Mother?

95
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,000
I have been training for this day, so why?

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,590
Why do they not perform?

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,740
You are good.

98
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,010
You put so much effort into it... really...

99
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,670
Mother...

100
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,580
Continue on... I will keep watching you.

101
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,880
All right.

102
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,120
Lady Uraha, please do not think
this mother is coldhearted.

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,420
No, ma'am.

104
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,630
Sir Ryuya, you do not need to worry
about my burial.

105
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,460
Do not touch my body, but just leave it here.

106
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,560
I have nothing to regret now.

107
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,370
I only wanted to share...

108
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,880
How I wish I could have spread my wings
together with this child...

109
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,540
To have flown in the summer sky to our
hearts' content, with this child...

110
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,480
Mother?

111
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,360
Mother, Mother, Mother...

112
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,160
Mother, Mother...

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,700
Kanna, that is enough.

114
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,230
Mother, Mother...
Kanna, that is enough.

115
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,890
Leave me alone! Get away from me!

116
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,260
Mother never lies. She said that I was good!

117
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,740
If I cannot throw the beanbags well,
it will make her a liar!

118
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
I must do it.

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,340
Mother is... Mother is watching!

120
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,350
Mother is...

121
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,180
Lady Kanna!

122
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,690
With such shabby arrows...

123
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,890
Lady Kanna...

124
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,280
Sir Ryuya, my guardian...

125
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,550
It was a difficult chore.

126
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:33,580
It was such a short time, but I was, I was...

127
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,460
Sir Ryuya!

128
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,050
Sir Ryuya, have some water.

129
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,380
I am fine. Please give it to Kanna.

130
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,390
It is my order. Drink.

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,180
This is all the water we have?

132
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,790
All right. Let us share.

133
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,910
Drink up all the rest.

134
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,780
When we are so close together like this,
we are as if...

135
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,900
...as if we are a close-knit family.

136
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,280
You're the one who said that a true family stays
so close they almost suffocate each other.

137
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,820
That is so true!

138
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,360
Do you two have any wishes?

139
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,420
Where did that come from?

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,930
Let me see... Can't think of one off hand...

141
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,140
It is to escape this siege,
even if I have to sacrifice my life.

142
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,700
At least let Kanna survive.

143
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,940
I have one.

144
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,310
I wish to live with Lady Kanna
and Sir Ryuya forever.

145
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,080
That might be good, too.

146
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,090
Let us set up a small residence
somewhere quiet.

147
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,990
I'll manage to supply food for us,
either by farming or hunting.

148
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,890
If we live by the ocean,
we could dig clams, as well.

149
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,700
The ocean...

150
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,160
If we're going to live by the ocean,
the warm, west side would be good.

151
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,810
What is the ocean like?

152
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,510
You don't know?

153
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,350
I heard that it is an unimaginably
large water puddle,

154
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,510
but I have never seen it myself.

155
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,980
It is a water puddle, but of only salt water.

156
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,720
You are teasing me again, are you not?

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,660
It is true, Lady Kanna.

158
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,100
What is more, the ocean is as big as the sky.

159
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,490
What?!

160
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,600
You can eat all the snappers
and abalone you wish.

161
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,570
Is that true?

162
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,160
That depends on my abilities.

163
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,400
I hope there are summer festivals
at seaside villages.

164
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,810
Yes, there should be.

165
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,750
Let us three dance together then.

166
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,350
Yes, it is not as much fun to just watch.

167
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,890
This is a dream, isn't it?

168
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,190
My dream.

169
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,390
Dreams are not all sad.

170
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,090
I have enjoyed myself.

171
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,590
Kanna...

172
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,000
Both of you. Do not move from here.

173
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,340
I was able to forget about my wings
while I was with you, Ryuya.

174
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,910
Kanna...

175
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,230
This is my last order.

176
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,100
Live a long and a happy life.

177
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,040
Kanna!

178
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,310
Don't hesitate! Shoot!

179
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,460
What are those voices?

180
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,430
It is a chant.

181
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,420
The priests are putting a spell on Lady Kanna.

182
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,700
Do not stop the chant!

183
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,440
In order to protect this world from
the curse of the winged being,

184
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,600
do not think about sparing your life!

185
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,310
Kanna! Fly higher! Higher!

186
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,000
Higher!

187
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,110
Kanna!

188
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,090
Kanna!

189
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,130
Sir Ryuya...

190
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,840
Kanna!

191
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,750
Sir Ryuya, what are you doing?

192
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,490
I don't care who it is.

193
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,790
I'm going to die and take as many of those
who did that to Kanna with me as I can.

194
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
If you get in my way, I will kill you.

195
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,970
Kill me then.

196
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,270
This is no idle threat.

197
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,700
My words are no mere threat, either.

198
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,340
How could Lady Kanna possibly be pleased
to see you transformed into an evil being?

199
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,920
Kanna is gone.

200
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,090
No. I can still hear Lady Kanna's voice.

201
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,590
What?

202
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,790
It is faint, but I can hear it.

203
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,420
Lady Kanna is crying.

204
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,960
Kanna is?

205
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,770
I see that you are
Kannabi-no-Mikoto's attendants.

206
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,510
In accordance with my master's order,
I am here to take you to him.

207
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,010
The one who summoned us was
a high-ranking priest, Chitoku.

208
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,420
Chitoku already knew pretty much
everything about Kanna.

209
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,650
There once lived a winged being
in this temple, a long time ago.

210
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,390
Since then, this temple
has protected winged beings

211
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,490
and at times, offered a helping hand.

212
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,700
According to Priest Chitoku,

213
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,030
winged beings inherit the planet's dream
from previous generations,

214
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,060
and have imparted pearls of wisdom
to the people since days of old.

215
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,700
It is said that one of them is the
source of our magic.

216
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,280
What does it mean "to inherit a dream"?

217
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,910
We do not know.

218
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,150
Because of the power they wielded,

219
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,260
winged beings were incarcerated
by the authorities of the time

220
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,750
and were used as weapons of war.

221
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,760
Kanna's mother had been cursed
by all those she had killed in wars.

222
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,730
That is why she said she was "defiled."

223
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,930
The army that invaded the sacred mountain
belonged to the Imperial Court.

224
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,110
Its goal was to undermine the worship of the
winged beings, and to unify the gods.

225
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,280
According to Chitoku, Kanna was probably
the last winged being in this world.

226
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,650
Priest Chitoku, I have a request.

227
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,590
Please give me magic powers.

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,860
It was decided that we would
live in this temple.

229
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,820
Uraha was said to have talent that appeared
only once in a hundred years.

230
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,000
Many long months passed.

231
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,010
I shall begin.

232
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,210
A chant to summon the spirits of the dead.

233
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,170
Through it, we shall discover what kind
of dreams Lady Kanna is having.

234
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,190
Sir Ryuya!

235
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,030
Sir Ryuya, get up!

236
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,900
It is my order!

237
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,030
Why do you not move?
Why do you not open your eyes?

238
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,200
I will not forgive you!
You are not allowed to leave me!

239
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,730
Why? Why does everyone... leave me?

240
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,670
No, that's not right, Kanna!

241
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm safe!

242
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,310
I'm right here!

243
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,620
Was that the dream Kanna's having?

244
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,820
Yes...

245
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,460
Are you saying she keeps having
this dream somewhere in the sky?

246
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,830
It is the curse that was put upon her
on the sacred mountain.

247
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,100
It continues to haunt her...

248
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,440
And the curses that she inherited
from her mother as well...

249
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,210
They will weaken those who cherish
the winged beings,

250
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,380
and eventually, they will lead them
to their death.

251
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,850
Is that the reason that my wound never heals?

252
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,980
Yes.

253
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,820
I can protect myself using magic, but you...

254
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,490
When am I to die?

255
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,430
You will not last another year.

256
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,060
I see.

257
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,400
The day will come when the curse
on Kanna will die out.

258
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,360
Then, her spirit will descend to
the Earth in a reincarnated form.

259
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,410
But putting a winged being's
spirit into a human

260
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,910
is like pouring the water of the ocean
into a small vial.

261
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,120
The vial will break before all
can be poured into it.

262
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,450
Her spirit will not have a chance to heal
and will continue to reincarnate.

263
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,600
I don't have much time.

264
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,570
Isn't there a way to save her?

265
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,620
There is only one way.

266
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,340
Please father a child.

267
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,500
Huh?

268
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,310
If you father a child,

269
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,080
you can leave your will with him,
can you not?

270
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,250
If not him, then your grandson, or even your
great grandson will carry out your wish.

271
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,220
And one day, a way to rescue Kanna
may be discovered.

272
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,930
I will help you.

273
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,340
I see.

274
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,640
But then, I will devote all of the
rest of my time to you.

275
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,600
Yes!

276
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,980
Time passes slowly.

277
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,010
In the back of the hut is the
"Writings on Winged Beings" that I compiled.

278
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:04,620
If our soon-to-be-born child seeks
Kanna's spirit, I trust that it will be helpful.

279
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,060
And Uraha will teach the child magic.

280
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm sure any child with Uraha's blood
will be an accomplished magician.

281
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,070
He might be able to follow the path
that we couldn't find.

282
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,000
I can continue the journey through time.

283
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,380
The journey to meet those
precious wings again.

284
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,150
I have nothing more to wish for.

285
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,480
I have no more regrets.

286
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,790
The birds are flying.

287
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,090
Yes.

288
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,670
You can just forget about me and Kanna,
and be happy.

289
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,830
I do not want that.

290
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,710
I am not alone.

291
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,700
You and Kanna will continue
to be with me and lead me.

292
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,880
I am happy.

293
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
I see.

294
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,810
That's exactly what makes you my dear wife.

295
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,260
Yes.

296
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,880
Thank you, Uraha.

297
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,690
Is it raining?

298
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,560
The sky is so high and clear, but...

299
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,810
Sir Ryuya.

300
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,350
Shall we go, Uraha?

301
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,220
Kanna is waiting for us beyond that sky.

302
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,310
Yes. I will accompany you wherever you go.

303
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,970
Where is this? Why am I here?

304
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,510
Oh yeah, I was with someone
until just a moment ago.

305
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,270
With someone very important...

306
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,550
It's no good. My head is foggy
and I can't remember.

307
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,650
I'm going to go to grandma's
after school tomorrow.

308
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,790
Oh, no! I forgot to bring my morning glory.

309
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,420
My grades are falling.

310
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,170
Where did you come from?

311
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,430
Where is your mother?

312
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,700
My mother?

313
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,030
Can't you fly?

314
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,790
How cute!

315
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,630
I wonder if it's okay to leave it here...

316
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,640
Okay, I'll walk away a little and turn around.
If he doesn't follow me, then I'll leave him.

317
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,950
Oh, he's following me.

318
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,120
Do you want to come with me?

319
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,720
Okay, then let's go together.

320
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,060
Set, Go!

321
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,720
Catching hold of the remnant

322
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,020
Of a dream that fades to white

323
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,790
The young boy runs

324
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,040
When he lets go

325
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,270
It vanishes forever with

326
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,050
The cry of the wind

327
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:55,680
A gentleness, once so apparent, is now gone

328
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:06,860
My eyes remain on the steps my feet take

329
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:15,610
Hearing forever the sounds of singing

330
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,250
That had faded away by morning

331
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:37,660
Always following in the footsteps we left behind

332

Next Episode

333
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Next Episode
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

334
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,170
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

335
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,770
I'm surprised he's so friendly...

336
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,140
I gave him a name: Sky.

337
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,170
Don't you have another one?

338
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,240
No way!

339
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,980
Piko piko piko...

340
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,500
Pikori...

341
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,400
Piko?

342
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,010
How long do I have to live like this, I wonder...

343
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,420
If I'm all alone, I won't be able to keep strong.

344
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,290
What should I do?

345
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,360
Misuzu, I'll be back.

346
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,460
Episode 10
Misuzu, I'll be back.

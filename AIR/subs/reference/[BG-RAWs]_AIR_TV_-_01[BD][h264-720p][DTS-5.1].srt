1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,780
My child, heed my words.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,690
The story I'm about to tell is a very important one.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:22,950
It is the story of a long, long journey, a story that will be passed on from parent to child forever.

4
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,550
Boy, am I starved!

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,290
Boy, am I hungry!

6
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,080
That's all you've been saying.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,530
You walk too slowly. Hurry up, will you?

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,350
Hey, you guys!

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,310
Do you know what a ramen set is?

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm absolutely starving right now!

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,800
I desperately want to eat a ramen set!

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,480
But...

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,780
Unfortunately, I'm broke. So...

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,870
Hey! It's time for a fun puppet show.

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,410
You can pay me afterwards.

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,570
What do you think? Isn't it great? Isn't it interesting? Isn't it fun?

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,170
What a filthy doll!

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,630
How ugly...

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,890
Can't it do anything else?

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,960
Take that! And that!

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,070
Kids are best when they're honest

22
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,430
You can pay me as much as you want.

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,530
That's why we're honestly saying it's ugly.

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,360
Why should we pay money for something like this?

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,300
Are you crazy?

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,640
Hey! You brats!

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,900
Run!

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,620
You brats, hold on!

29
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,680
It's hot...

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,250
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

31
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,370
Kieru hikoukigumo bokutachi wa miokutta
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:03,600
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,000
We ran away because it was so bright

45
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:32,460
The children walk along the summer railways

The children walk along the summer railways

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,420

A-A ramen set!

68
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,510
－episode one－

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,140
Hello!

70
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,930
<i>What's with this girl?</i>

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,690
Are you alone?

72
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,520
It's hot, isn't it?

73
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,440
<i>What? What is she after? Money? I don't have any money.</i>

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,990
Aren't you thirsty?

75
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,950
I'll go and buy something!

76
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,010
Here!

77
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,630
Had a little trouble there, huh?

78
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,930
Gao!

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,400
<i>"Gooey and Thick - Peach Flavor"?</i>

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,280
Why did you do that?

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,490
You're making fun of me, aren't you?!

82
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,200
Not at all.

83
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,870
This tastes really good.

84
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,040
Would you like to go to the beach?

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,250
Why?

86
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,880
Because I want to play.

87
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,630
What?!

88
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,760
Yesterday, the kids were playing on the beach.

89
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,980
I thought, "It looks like they're having fun. I want to play too"...

90
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
...the whole time you were asleep next to me

91
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
You were watching me?

92
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,190
You've been asleep since yesterday, haven't you?

93
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,240
I poked you to try to wake you up, but you didn't look like you were going to.

94
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,700
I was so hungry I couldn't move.

95
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,910
Where are you going?

96
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,950
To work.

97
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,330
Work? What do you do?

98
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,160
A puppet sho-

99
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,450
Huh?

100
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,750
It's gone!

101
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,670
Is it really that important?

102
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,510
I need it to work.

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,390
It's hot, right? Go on and head home.

104
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,770
There it is!

105
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,180
Crow! Crow!

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,310
You're going after the wrong one!
Crow! Crow!

107
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,980
Weren't we lucky we found it?

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,230
Yeah, we were. It's all thanks to you.

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,690
Now you can play with me, right?

110
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,530
What are you after?

111
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,110
Why have you been hanging around me?

112
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,910
Like I said, I want to play on the beach.

113
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,330
We can play tag, and splash water on each other.

114
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,460
And, at the end, we'll say, "See you tomorrow!" and part ways.

115
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,000
That sounds like something that friends would do.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,420
Yeah. Friends...

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
You and I are friends.

118
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,390
So...

119
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,680
I want to play!

120
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,140
We don't even know each other's names.

121
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,640
My name is Kamio Misuzu. What's yours?

122
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,900
Kunisaki Yukito...

123
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,440
But listen! I have work to do.

124
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm hungry, so I have to earn some money.

125
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,570
Oh! If that's the case...

126
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,450
I ended up following her home, lured by the thought of food.

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,250
It's nice to eat with someone else, isn't it?

128
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,250
Do you usually eat alone?

129
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,210
My Mom gets home late. And I don't have a Dad.

130
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
After you finish eating, let's go play, okay?

131
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,840
No. If it gets late, I'll have trouble finding a place to stay.

132
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,640
You haven't found a place to stay yet?

133
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,890
No. I'll probably end up sleeping outside.

134
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,480
You can stay here!

135
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,190
Now, listen. We just met today.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,980
And you have no idea who the heck I am.

137
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,650
I'm a stranger.

138
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,110
Who in their right mind would let someone like that stay the night?

139
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,160
Your mother probably wouldn't allow it anyway.

140
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,950
My Mom's really lax, so I don't think it will be a problem.

141
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,370
Although I guess I shouldn't talk about my mother like that.

142
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,580
But really, it's okay for you to stay here.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,670
I'm tired. I don't have the energy to play with you.

144
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,380
Then we can play tomorrow.

145
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,050
It's summer vacation, so I have lots of time.

146
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,590
No.

147
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,050
G-gao...

148
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,020
Say... What kind of use do you think math has?

149
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,110
Do you think stuff like quadratic
functions will be useful in my future?

150
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,020
How should I know?

151
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,440
Anyway, why am I helping you with your homework?!

152
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,280
Hey, your eyes are too close.

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,030
You sound just like my Mom, Yukito-san.

154
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,990
Do I?

155
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,460
My Mom's home.

156
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,380
Hey!

157
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,630
She ran into the shed with her motorcycle.

158
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,970
Don't worry. It happens all the time.

159
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,430
Are you really sure it's okay for me to be here?

160
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,470
Sure! I'll smooth it over with her-

161
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,600
Absolutely not!

162
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,140
This isn't going the way you said it would.

163
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,770
It doesn't matter what you say!

164
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,850
There's no way we can let a young man like him stay here!

165
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,860
G-gao!

166
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,730
Ouch!

167
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,320
How many times do I have to tell ya to stop saying that?!

168
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,530
What's your relation to Misuzu?

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,740
Uh... Classmate.

170
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,540
What? Aren't you a bit old for that?

171
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't fall for me.

172
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,130
As if I would?!

173
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,510
Well, you <i>do</i> seem to have pluck. I like that about you.

174
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,840
That's right. Yukito-san is a really nice guy.

175
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,010
All right. He can stay.

176
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,010
You're serious?

177
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,140
Serious? Of course! I'm dead serious.

178
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,520
But there are TWO conditions.

179
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,270
First, you sleep in the shed.

180
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,100
And second...

181
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,110
You will be my drinking partner.

182
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,450
And then in the end, this is what the guy said...

183
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,450
"Maybe I was the one who fell in love."

184
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,700
Whaddya think? I win, right?

185
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,410
And so I told him...

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,420
"The fish you let escape was a mermaid, you know..."

187
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,380
How was that? Pretty good, huh?

188
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,300
Why does it end up like this?

189
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,880
Mom's in top form.

190
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,930
Hey, Freeloader. Why're you looking so glum? Why don't ya join in?

191
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,350
MY EYES!

192
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,310
Yukito-san!

193
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,810
Do something? What do you want me to do?

194
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,270
Anything will do. A tale of an erotic confession or a hidden talent...

195
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,730
I see... In that case...

196
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,450
Oh, that puppet from earlier.

197
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,370
Wow! That's impressive!

198
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,330
This is how I earn my living.

199
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,960
My mother used to travel with this as her trade.

200
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,750
When do we get to the punchline?

201
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,720
No good. You got no sense at all.

202
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,890
But it's amazing that he can do that without using any tricks.

203
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,810
Who cares?

204
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,730
As long as the show's funny, it's better, even if the strings are easily visible.

205
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,850
I'm going to bed.

206
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Oh! He's going off to the shed on his own!

207
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,230
Hey, there's nothing wrong with having no talent!

208
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,030
Let's drink up and forget about it, huh?

209
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,490
My name's Haruko. Kamio Haruko.

210
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,450
One more drink, ma'am.

211
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,750
I told you my name so you wouldn't call me that!

212
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,830
You're a really thoughtless guy!

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,210
So... You a runaway?

214
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,090
I'm on a journey.

215
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,760
You chasing a goal or a dream?

216
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,680
Maybe.

217
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,640
You're so young...

218
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,720
Well, compared to you...

219
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,690
You're a funny guy, aren't you?

220
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,350
Am I?

221
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,770
I may not look like it, but I have a pretty good eye for men.

222
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,440
I wouldn't mind if you stayed on for a while.

223
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,110
But I have a favor to ask.

224
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,280
Would you look after her?

225
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,490
Huh?

226
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,580
She's a little bit prone to getting into trouble, right?

227
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,950
She's careless, and once something catches her eye, she goes off like a bullet.

228
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,660
What am I, a babysitter?

229
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,380
Also, I'd like you to fix that strange habit she has.

230
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,050
You've heard her say "Gao", haven't you?

231
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,880
When she's frustrated or about to cry?

232
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,010
Yeah...

233
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,890
That's supposed to sound like a dinosaur.

234
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,350
She loves dinosaurs. She's been saying that ever since she was little.

235
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,560
She's still just a child...

236
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,990
What's up? Isn't it summer vacation?

237
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,530
To be honest, I have to take remedial classes.

238
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,990
Has Haruko already left?

239
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,250
Yeah. She leaves early every morning.

240
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,420
It's been a while since I've had company for breakfast.

241
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,880
What are you going to do today, Yukito-san?

242
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,220
First, I'm going to walk you to school. Haruko asked me to do it.

243
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,760
She wanted me to watch over you to
make sure you didn't do anything stupid.

244
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,810
She doesn't trust me at all.

245
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,720
Gao!

246
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm done drawing a map of this town!

247
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,230
That was fast.

248
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,730
Now you'll know where to find people gathering together.

249
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,070
This should help with your work, right?

250
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,610
Yeah, thanks.

251
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,320
Oh, I'm going to be late.

252
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,200
I'm in a pinch!

253
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,420
I'll come to pick you up after school. We'll meet right here.

254
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,330
Okay!

255
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,850
Here.
Delicious!
It's the ocean!
Munch Munch.
I'm
 studying.
Japanese
 use
 these,
 right?

256
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,430
W-What in the world is this?
Here.
Delicious!
It's the ocean!
Munch Munch.
I'm
 studying.
Japanese
 use
 these,
 right?

257
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,680
Here.
Delicious!
It's the ocean!
Munch Munch.
I'm
 studying.
Japanese
 use
 these,
 right?

258
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,640
Is this how she sees the world?

259
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,520
What do you want?

260
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,740
Are you this town's local legendary creature?

261
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,700
If that's the case, if I do it a favor, like in those fairytales,

262
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,790
maybe it'll give me something in return.

263
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,710
Okay. Come here. I'll show you something good.

264
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,130
What do you think?

265
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,720
Isn't it such a wonderful act that it makes you feel like giving me something in return?

266
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,260
Hey!

267
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,060
Wait!

268
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,790
Give up, you evil extraterrestrial!

269
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,500
You won't get away!

270
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,380
What are you doing?

271
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,430
A strange extraterrestrial being ran away with my puppet.

272
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,890
You mean this?

273
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,900
Potato isn't an extraterrestrial.

274
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,360
He's a neighborhood stray dog.

275
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,190
You mean, that's really a dog?

276
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,820
I see...

277
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,780
Huh?

278
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,370
I see...

279
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,450
I'm sorry he caused you so much trouble.

280
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,750
Why are you apologizing?

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,750
Well, Potato said that he brought your puppet here.

282
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,710
It seems he wanted to play with you.

283
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,260
You mean you can understand what he's saying?

284
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,170
Yes! We're best friends.

285
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,630
Right, Potato?

286
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,140
It seems that there are still worlds here on Earth that I know nothing about.

287
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,890
Thanks.

288
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,060
Are you hurt or something?

289
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,860
Oh, this?

290
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,360
Well, uh...

291
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,150
Nope! I have to keep it a secret.

292
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,620
My name is Kirishima Kano. What's your name?

293
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,950
I'm Kunisaki Yukito.

294
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,250
Do you have some free time, by any chance?

295
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,040
I guess...

296
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,380
Okay! Then you will be Citizen Number 2 of Planet Dilly-Dally.

297
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,710
Who's Number 1?

298
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,010
Me! And Potato is Number 3.

299
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,890
And what do the citizens of Planet Dilly-Dally do?

300
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,720
They just have time on their hands.

301
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,680
That is the fate of those from Planet Dilly-Dally.

302
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,560
Right? We have nothing to do, do we, Potato?

303
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,400
I have to go to school, so I'll say good-bye for now.

304
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,730
I thought you were from Planet Dilly-Dally?

305
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,570
You believed that? You're such a kid!

306
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,620
So long!

307
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,160
Are all the girls who wear that uniform weird?

308
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,910
Hey!

309
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,710
What is it?

310
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,380
Have you ever wished you could do magic?

311
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,510
What?

312
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,890
You're stunned! So long!

313
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,510
Magic?

314
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,360
Oh, Yukito-san!

315
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,320
How did your work go?

316
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,700
I made a mint.

317
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,990
Really?

318
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,030
I'm sorry. I lied.

319
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,410
I have to find someplace where there are more people or I won't be able to make a living.

320
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,830
Why is this place so quiet when people should be returning from work?

321
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,130
Well, this station is closed down.

322
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,840
You should have told me that earlier.

323
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,420
G-gao!

324
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,010
Ouch!

325
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,510
Why'd you hit me?

326
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,100
Haruko told me to scold you whenever you say that.

327
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,520
Oh! How cute!

328
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,400
It's Tohno-san...

329
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,490
You know her?

330
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,400
Yeah.

331
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,240
Why are you getting so anxious?

332
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,000
H-hello!

333
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,580
Hello. This is unexpected.

334
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,050
Y-yes. Quite a coincidence.

335
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,340
I'm astonished.

336
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,010
What were you doing?

337
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,220
Getting some sun.

338
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,600
Just kidding. It's evening right now.

339
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,600
Hey, who the heck is this girl?

340
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,860
It's Tohno Minagi-san. She's my classmate.

341
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,070
She's smart. She's at the top of our grade, and she's president of the Astronomy Club.

342
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,990
Please just call me Tohno.

343
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,580
Hey! Minagi!

344
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,580
Oh, Yukito-san is flying like a leaf!

345
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,000
Hey, hey! Let's hurry up and go back to blowing bubbles!

346
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,550
I'm doing really good now, you know!

347
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:18,880
Please!

348
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,890
Is this girl your little sister?

349
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,390
No, I'm not. I'm Michiru, Minagi's best friend.

350
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,930
And who could you be?

351
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm Tohno-san's classmate.

352
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,900
That hurt, you know.

353
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,860
What?! Are you another one of Minagi's classmates?

354
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm an innocent passerby who got bowled over by you.

355
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,530
I've got it! Minagi, this is a perverted kidnapper who's after us!

356
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,080
I'm on this side too?

357
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,250
Who are you calling a kidnapper?!

358
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,500
Yikes! He's mad!

359
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,460
We young girls are in trouble!

360
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,000
Wow, did you hear that sound?

361
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,420
Kamio-san, who is this?

362
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,140
Kunisaki Yukito-san. He's a traveler who's staying with us now.

363
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,760
A traveler?

364
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,430
A homeless, perverted kidnapper? He's a lost cause, right?

365
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,490
Kamio-san, I think we'd better be going.

366
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,950
What? But I was doing really well blowing bubbles.

367
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,620
Let's do it some more. Kami-Kami can join us, too.

368
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,330
Kami-Kami? Is that me?

369
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,590
It's getting dark, so let's do it again tomorrow.

370
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,840
I'll pack a lunch for us.

371
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,300
So long, Kamio!

372
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,100
Kunisaki Yukito!

373
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,810
Yeah?

374
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,440
Get lost, will you?!

375
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,770
What was that?!

376
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,740
Hey, hey, will you make me hamburger patties for lunch tomorrow?

377
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,570
All right.

378
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,450
Really? Hurray!

379
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,160
Did I do something to that kid?

380
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,120
Hmm, I don't know.

381
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,330
I didn't make a single yen today.

382
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,290
You were standing there like that when we met yesterday, too.

383
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,300
Ever since I was little, I've had this longing for the sky.

384
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,720
Why?

385
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,550
I don't know.

386
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
It's just...

387
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,520
I just have a feeling like... there's another me out there...

388
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,610
That's a romantic thought, isn't it? That the real you is in the sky...

389
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,610
I bet it would feel really nice.

390
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,440
You'd be able to see far into the distance,

391
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,860
and everything that happens in this world would seem so insignificant.

392
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,330
You'd really be able to feel at ease, I'm sure.

393
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,330
Misuzu... You're...

394
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:09,340
That was the start of a summer that seemed to me as
evanescent as the twinkling of a star, yet as long as eternity.

395
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,140
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

396
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:27,500
Catching hold of the scrap of a dream that fades to white

398
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:28,820
Shounen wa hashiru

399
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,390
The young boy runs
Shounen wa hashiru

400
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,030
The young boy runs

401
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:33,490
Te wo hanashitara dokomademo tooku kaze no ne ni kieteyuku

402
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:47,610
When he lets go, it goes on forever, vanishing into the cry of the wind

404
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,260
Itsuka mieta yasashisa wa mou nai

The kindness I could once see is now gone
Itsuka mieta yasashisa wa mou nai

Hitori fumidasu ashidake miteru
The kindness I could once see is now gone

All I see now are the steps my feet take

Asa ni wa kieta ano utagoe wo itsumademo kiiteta
All I see now are the steps my feet take

411
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:21,970
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning
Asa ni wa kieta ano utagoe wo itsumademo kiiteta

412
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,330
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning

It might be the other you whom I've been looking for.

420
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,900
I'm not cut out to be a parent. I should have stayed alone.

421
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,580
I had a dream. A strange dream. A dream about the sky.

422
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,830
I was in the sky.

423
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,620
It was a world I'd never seen before.

424
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,710
Everything went on into infinity.

425
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,710
Hey, did you have wings in your dream?

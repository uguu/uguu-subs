1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,090
It might be the other you whom I've been looking for.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,780
Somewhere beyond this sky is a girl with wings.

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,670
She's been there forever, and is still there even now.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,180
Somewhere in the same atmosphere,

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,000
she continues to spread her wings to catch the wind.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,600
My mother died before she could give me any more details.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,220
Ever since then, my only companions have been that story of the girl in the sky and this puppet.

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,220
Are you also trying to find that girl your mother was searching for?

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,140
Of course, there's no way you're that girl.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,890
A lot of people dream about flying through the sky.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,720
That girl can fly too, right?

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,170
Yeah. She has wings.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,990
Wow... I wish I had wings too.

14
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,300
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

I'm home!

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,080
Hey, Freeloader! A present for ya!

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,130
A sloth.

54
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,330
Isn't this one cuter than that dirty puppet of yours?

55
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,860
We need to have you make some money and get out of here soon.

56
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,670
He's cute.

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,800
<b>episode two</b>

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,940
There's nothing like a drink after work!

59
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,910
It's like, "This is the reason I'm alive!"

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,440
Okay, Freeloader, tonight our subject will be "Touching memories that bring a tear to the eye"!

61
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,310
Go ahead and entertain yourself.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
What, are you sleepy, Misuzu?

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,180
Yeah, I guess.

64
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,670
Come over here. You can use my lap as a pillow.

65
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,660
What?! T-that's okay, I'm not a kid.

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,010
I'm going to bed.

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,260
Good night.

68
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,800
Good night.

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,600
Oh, dear. She ran away.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,010
Do you have her lay her head on your lap a lot?

71
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,000
Are ya crazy? That was a joke.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,220
Do you think she would cuddle up to someone as incompetent as me?

73
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,630
Was that girl saying 'Gao' today too?"

74
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,300
Yeah. I whacked her each time she said it.

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,610
That girl...

76
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,270
When she was little, for some reason, she thought chicks were dinosaur babies.

77
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,130
And so, when she saw the chicks at the summer fair, she begged for one.

78
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,290
But we were so poor then, I couldn't buy one for her.

79
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,690
And ever since, she learned to say "Gao" for every little thing.

80
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,690
I'm not cut out to be a parent.

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,450
I should have stayed alone.

82
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,700
Besides, that child is a little weird.

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,000
Weird?

84
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,920
But, she seems to cheer up when she's with you,

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,650
...so I hope you stay friends with her.

86
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,510
There's nothing more I can do for her.

87
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,450
Okay, it's time for a fun puppet show!

88
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,500
What is this?

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,310
It's kinda creepy.
What is this?

90
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,990
It's kinda creepy.

91
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,280
It's like something you might see in a dream... I mean a nightmare.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,890
Come on. Let's go.

93
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,420
Hey! Leave some coins!

94
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,140
You didn't help business at all!

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,660
You again. Your name was Potato, was it?

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,880
What are you doing?

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
- Is your daughter well?
What are you doing?

98
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,310
- Is your daughter well?

99
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,780
Yes. She says white rice tastes so good, and asks for seconds and thirds,

100
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,910
So I enjoy cooking for her.

101
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,810
Please tell her to be careful of an upset stomach.

102
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,520
I will. Well, good-bye.

103
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,310
Now...

104
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,590
What have you been doing in front of my place?

105
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,720
Well, shall we go home, Bubbles-

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,170
- Hey now, don't ignore me like that!
Well, shall we go home, Bubbles-

107
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,130
- Hey now, don't ignore me like that!

108
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,060
Hey, it's Potato. What's he doing?

109
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,390
You know him?

110
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,690
Oh, Yukito-kun?

111
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,200
Yukito-kun is talking to Big Sis!

112
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,990

<b>Kirishima Clinic</b>

113
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,210
Wow, that's amazing! He's good, isn't he?

114
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,170
It looks like Potato's become a fan of Yukito.

115
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,570
You say your name's Kunisaki Yukito-kun, right?

116
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,760
Your technique is admirable,

117
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,640
but I doubt you'll be able to make much money with that trick.

118
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,320
You say that, but I've been using just this trick in all the cities I've passed through.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,290
Oh! That must mean you've made a lot of money in this town, too!

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,960
Huh? You haven't?

121
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,330
Would you be interested in working at this clinic?

122
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,970
My name is Kirishima Hijiri.

123
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,630
Since our parents died, I've been the only doctor in this town.

124
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,790
I've been looking for someone to do odd jobs.

125
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,420
Why bamboo?

126
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,090
How nice! I've always wanted to try this.

127
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,490
Why are you eating soumen for lunch?

128
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,560
In this household, if Kano asks for soumen, that's what we eat.

129
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,380
No matter how you look at it, I'm in an unfair position here.

130
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,390
Why? You seem to be quite hungry.

131
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,330
All right. Then, come at around the same time tomorrow.

132
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,790
You're going to pay me well, I hope.

133
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,660
Then, as an added benefit,

134
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,710
I will allow you to put on your puppet show in front of my clinic.

135
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,310
Don't worry. I'll at least feed you lunch.

136
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,280
It was fun! Let's play again tomorrow, Yukito-kun!

137
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,760
So long!

138
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,540
Did I make a mistake taking that job?

139
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,400
Man, there sure aren't many people walking around this town.

140
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,520
There must not be many traffic accidents-

141
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,230
Oh... I'm so sorry!

142
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,490
No... I'm sorry.

143
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,290
I really appreciate your doing this.

144
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,580
D-Don't mention it.

145
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,000
I bear some responsibility for running into you.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,900
But, this sure is a lot...

147
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,870
My daughter loves rice and eats so much of it, that I just...

148
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,230
Thank you very much.

149
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,470
It's not much, but to thank you...

150
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,840
N-no. No thanks. That's not why I did it...

151
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,000
You must take it. It isn't much but, here.

152
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,490
Doesn't anyone use currency in this town?

153
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,510
And by the way, what kind of girl would eat up all that rice?

154
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,670
Misuzu's sure late

155
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,160
Oh, it's a sloth!

156
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,430
He's so cute!

157
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,670
She's like a mini version of Misuzu.

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,960
Hey you, where are your parents?

159
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,090
Huh?

160
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,060
Don't tell me you're lost.

161
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,690
You want to eat this?

162
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,040
It's yummy and cute...

163
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,700
Yummy or cute. Choose one or the other.

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,330
Cute and yummy.

165
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,410
Oh, Yukito-san.

166
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,090
Where'd that little girl come from?

167
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,150
I think she's lost.

168
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,030
What's your name?

169
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,880
Six years old.

170
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
What a name!

171
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,340
Keep quiet, Yukito-san.

172
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,380
What's your name? It's what you say before your age, right?

173
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,390
Shino Saika. I'm six.

174
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,090
Oh, Shino-san.

175
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,620
I heard that girl has to be admitted to the hospital.

176
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
She's sick? Is it serious?

177
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,700
No. It doesn't seem too serious.

178
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,870
And besides, she said the sloth has become her friend, so she'll be all right.

179
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,570
I see.

180
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,900
I had a dream.

181
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,980
That's nothing unusual. I have them too.

182
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,700
A strange dream. A dream about the sky.

183
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,270
I was in the sky. It was a world I'd never seen before.

184
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,000
See, when you sit like this, the clouds are above you.

185
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,990
But in my dream, the clouds were packed below me.

186
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,980
I could see the blue of the sea between the clouds.

187
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,970
But I couldn't tell how far it was to there.

188
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,150
Everything went on into infinity.

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,210
Hey.

190
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,150
Did you have wings in your dream?

191
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,930
Huh? I don't know... I didn't notice.

192
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,230
You shouldn't go around telling people about such dreams.

193
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,170
Don't worry. You're the only one I've told.

194
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,350
Oh, it looks surprisingly good on you.

195
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,910
Don't you have a different one?

196
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,650
All of the other ones are small.

197
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,820
Yup, it smells nice.

198
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,330
What is this?

199
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,370
Lunch. I put all my effort into it so it's very delicious.

200
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,260
Lunch?!

201
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,430
You made it especially for-

202
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,300
Deliver it to Kano, will you?

203
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,050
Anything wrong?

204
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,100
Nothing...

205
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,670
Kano is at school taking care of the animals today.

206
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,740
Let me make this clear. If you dare to eat it on the way...

207
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,100
I will deliver it swiftly and safely!

208
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
There are quite a few students.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,330
I guess they're here for remedial classes, club activities or school committees.

210
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,320
This might be a good place for my business.

211
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,540
Everyone, I want to hear you laugh out loud over my puppet show!

212
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,760
Kunisaki's the greatest!

213
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,020
Everybody, say it!

214
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,170
Kunisaki's the greatest!

215
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,990
Love and Peace!

216
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,800
Kunisaki's the greatest!

217
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,870
As if that'll ever happen.

218
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,430
If I took this weird creature in there,

219
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,060
the whole high school might be thrown into a panic.

220
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,870
Don't move from here until I tell you it's okay.

221
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,020
I have a question for you.

222
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:50,970
Yes?

223
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,530
I'm here to deliver lunch to Kirishima Kano,

224
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,930
do you know where she is?

225
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,730
To Kanorin?

226
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,280
Maybe Kanorin's still in the nurse's office.

227
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,220
The nurse's office?

228
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,750
No, no. She said she wanted to get some fresh air so she was going up to the roof.

229
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,700
She mumbled something, and then suddenly collapsed.

230
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,000
I think she just got a little light-headed.

231
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,050
I see... So you worried about me.

232
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,080
Are you sure you're okay?

233
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,520
You're overreacting. I just got a little dizzy.

234
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,850
I see.

235
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,180
The sky is so clear, isn't it?

236
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,400
Yukito-kun, can't you fly?

237
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,760
Of course not.

238
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,430
But you can move your puppet.

239
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,010
That has absolutely nothing to do with anything.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,020
By the way, you were talking about my wishing I could use magic or something.

241
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,960
Oh, that? I asked because I can use magic.

242
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,010
That's not completely true. I can't use my powers until I grow up.

243
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,320
But, I've already decided what I'm going to do the first time I use my magic.

244
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,240
What are you going to do?

245
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,190
It's a secret.

246
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,850
But I can tell you what I'll do second.

247
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,360
I don't really want to hear about it.

248
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,030
What? You've got to listen.

249
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,950
If you don't listen, it'll claw its way out of my belly,

250
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,090
and it'll turn into something no human can counter!

251
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,110
And Earth, Earth will be in a big jam! Right?

252
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,340
Yes! You've got to protect the Earth!

253
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,870
So what's the second thing you want to do?

254
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,070
Well...

255
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,450
I want to fly through the sky.

256
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,460
Magic to fly through the sky...

257
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,540
Hey! Kunisaki Yukito!

258
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,800
Quit attacking me, will you?!

259
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,960
Why are you mad?

260
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,440
And after I went through all the trouble of calling to you, too!

261
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,560
Shut up, will you?!

262
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,760
My brains are sloshing.

263
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,860
Oh! What a dirty doll!

264
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,810
Oh, that's mine.

265
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,080
It's all tattered. Poor thing.

266
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,480
You're suffering under your stupid master, aren't you?

267
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,350
Don't say it so soulfully!

268
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,860
- All right, I will save you!
Don't say it so soulfully!

269
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,560
- All right, I will save you!

270
00:15:59,560 --> 00:15:59,810
What?!
- All right, I will save you!

271
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,100
What?!

272
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,580
See you 'round!

273
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,340
- Hey! Wait a minute!
See you 'round!

274
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,030
- Hey! Wait a minute!

275
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,450
Come and get me!

276
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,440
Are you from the planet Butt Sway?

277
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,450
Hey! Where are you going?!

278
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,150
Catch me if you can!

279
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,560
Enough is... enough, I tell you!

280
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,890
Oh! Minagi!

281
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,470
You're lucky! You get to have Minagi fix it.

282
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,000
So, where's your "thank you"?

283
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,230
Who are you to act so high and mighty?!

284
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,800
Ta-da. I'm done.

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,250
Oh, it's nice now!

286
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,330
- Whoa. Not bad...
Oh, it's nice now!

287
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:45,370
Oh, it's nice now!

288
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,570
Ahem.

289
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,750
It must be a very precious doll for you to always be carrying it.

290
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah, I guess.

291
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,630
It's the physical form of a precious memory...

292
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,800
Am I wrong?

293
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,080
I don't know...

294
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

295
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,310
That ruined the mood!

296
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,110
- Shut up!
That ruined the mood!

297
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,680
- Shut up!

298
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,140
I present you with a coupon for rice.

299
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,630
You're hungry, are you not?

300
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,000
Tohno-san is amazing, isn't she?

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,830
Not only is she good at her studies, but she's good at sewing, too.

302
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,900
So, where are we headed?

303
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,980
A place where lots of people gather.

304
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,300
If you put on your puppet show there, lots of people should gather.

305
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,470
It's Mom.

306
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,700
What sort of work does Haruko do?

307
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,850
It's a secret.

308
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,530
I wonder if she went to say a prayer at the shrine.

309
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,260
The shrine?

310
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,190
Yeah. Where we're headed now.

311
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,090
Hey, there's no one here!

312
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,650
It's almost time for the Summer Festival.

313
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,760
It'll be full of people then. Lots of kids from town will come.

314
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,440
The kids in this town are all smart-mouths though.

315
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,080
Oh! Wait!

316
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,180
What is it?

317
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,610
Well, uhh... Since we're here, I thought we could play some more.

318
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,480
Let's play hide-and-seek!

319
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,340
What?!

320
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,390
I want to play hide-and-seek with you, Yukito-san.

321
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,250
How old are we, anyway?

322
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,800
Then... Then let's catch bugs.

323
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,210
Gao!

324
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,160
Oh, fish!

325
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,520
I want to catch fish.

326
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,980
You don't care what it is, do you?

327
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,740
It's summer vacation, so I want to play as much as I can.

328
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,030
Hey, Misuzu!

329
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,730
Listen, I'm leaving! Understand?!

330
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
Huh?

331
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,040
Gotcha!

332
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,890
By the way, do you still believe that chicks grow into dinosaurs?

333
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,340
Gosh, I know now that chicks grow up to be chickens.

334
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:40,150
Actually, what I really wanted wasn't a chick or a baby dinosaur.

335
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,870
I heard that you cried all day long.

336
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,670
If my Mom had bought me something,

337
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,590
I would've been happy with it no matter what it was.

338
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,800
That was fun!

339
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,850
Was it? That's good.

340
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,790
I've never had so much fun on my birthday before, so it was great.

341
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,120
It's your birthday today?

342
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,010
Yeah.

343
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,010
Why didn't you tell me such an important thing?

344
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,360
Huh? But...

345
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,770
If I'd known, I would've bought you a present.

346
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,450
Yukito-san?

347
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,910
Go on home.

348
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,200
No one would watch a puppet show so late in the day.

349
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,210
Oh, are you done for the day?

350
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,690
Can you show me something quick?

351
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,460
That's amazing. Hmm...

352
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,940
But I don't suppose kids would be interested.

353
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,050
It's none of your business.

354
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,070
That was rude of me.

355
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,320
What is this?

356
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,290
I went to visit an acquaintance, but no one was home.

357
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,810
I'll give it to you for showing me something so unusual.

358
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,260
It's really good.

359
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,130
It was lucky that what I got just happened to be a cake.

360
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,890
And there were just the number of candles I would need.

361
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,740
I wonder if he was planning to celebrate someone's birthday.

362
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,530
Doesn't Haruko remember that today is your birthday?

363
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,040
Mom's busy.

364
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,480
How pretty...

365
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,300
Now are you satisfied?

366
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,350
Yup. I'm happy.

367
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,110
Then, shall we go home?

368
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,340
Kano...

369
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,280
H-hey, Kano!

370
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,730
The shrine again?

371
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,940
I thought she went in.

372
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,660
<i>Like the number of stars in the heavens,</i>

373
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,600
<i>the number of trees in the mountains,</i>

374
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>the number of grasses in the field.</i>

375
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,100
Kano!

376
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:19,840
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

377
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:29,200
Catching hold of the scrap of a dream that fades to white
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

378
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,520
Catching hold of the scrap of a dream that fades to white

379
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,520
Shounen wa hashiru

380
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,090
The young boy runs
Shounen wa hashiru

381
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,730
The young boy runs

382
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,190
Te wo hanashitara dokomademo tooku kaze no ne ni kieteyuku

383
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:49,310
When he lets go, it goes on forever, vanishing into the cry of the wind
Te wo hanashitara dokomademo tooku kaze no ne ni kieteyuku

384
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,830
When he lets go, it goes on forever, vanishing into the cry of the wind

385
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:49,960
Itsuka mieta yasashisa wa mou nai

386
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,400
The kindness I could once see is now gone
Itsuka mieta yasashisa wa mou nai

00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,130
Hitori fumidasu ashidake miteru
The kindness I could once see is now gone

389
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:08,700
All I see now are the steps my feet take
Hitori fumidasu ashidake miteru

Asa ni wa kieta ano utagoe wo itsumademo kiiteta
All I see now are the steps my feet take

392
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:23,670
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning
Asa ni wa kieta ano utagoe wo itsumademo kiiteta

393
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,030
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning

Bokura ga nokoshita ano ashiato wo itsumademo otteta
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning

Bokura ga nokoshita ano ashiato wo itsumademo otteta

Always following the footprints we left behind

405
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,350
Telekinetic ability... There are so many wonders in this world...

406
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,540
She's always a little weird, isn't she?

407
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,960
That's not what I mean.

408
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,720
Oh... if there's nothing, it's all right.

409
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,580
What are you talking about?

410
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,000

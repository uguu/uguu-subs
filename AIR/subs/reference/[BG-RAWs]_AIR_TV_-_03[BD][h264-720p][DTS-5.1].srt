1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,600
What's going on?

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,620
Kano!

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,950
Wake up!

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,100
Hey, Kano!

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,200
Don't be so rough with her!

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,220
It hurts... It really hurts...

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,140
Big Sis...

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,010
Wha? Yukito-kun?

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,080
Where am I?

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,980
What... happened to me?

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:35,880
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,000
Kieru hikoukigumo bokutachi wa miokutta
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,230
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,630
We ran away because it was so bright

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,270
Mabushikute nigeta
We ran away because it was so bright

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,320
I was so bitter that I released your finger

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,450

Kuyashikute yubi wo hanasu
I was so bitter that I released your finger

00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,950

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,410
There are still unreachable places in the distance

Todokanai basho ga mada tooku ni aru
There are still unreachable places in the distance

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:04,920
There are still unreachable places in the distance

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,390

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,790

That she gazes at with her wishes tucked away

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:11,800
That she gazes at with her wishes tucked away

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,090
The children walk along the summer railways

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,100
Kodomotachi wa natsu no senro aruku
The children walk along the summer railways

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,310
Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,760
ryoute ni wa tobidatsu kibou wo
Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:26,770
Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

31
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,050
We've been chasing and chasing after the disappearing vapor trails

We've been chasing and chasing after the disappearing vapor trails

We've been chasing and chasing after the disappearing vapor trails

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:34,880

kitto

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,750
Can you stand?

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,910
Yes.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,430
Thank you.

51
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,820
Don't worry about it. But you don't remember anything?

52
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,990
No. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,680
You don't need to apologize, but...

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,600
What happened in that pampas grass field?

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,660
You saw it too?

56
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,710
Kano!

57
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,490
What is the meaning of this?!

58
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,700
Okay, listen carefully.

59
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,850
Yes, I am holding her, but this is not what you think it is.

60
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,840
It's not like I gave an innocent girl alcohol and took her into some isolated place-

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,500
That's enough!

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,030
Wait, wait a minute!

63
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,600
Big Sis?

64
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,020
episode three

65
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,710
I can't say it enough, but I am very sorry.

66
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,130
I wasn't aware of the situation and I got a little upset.

67
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,890
You call that "a little" upset? You old maid.

68
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,970
Did you say something?

69
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,890
Oh no, nothing.

70
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,550
I have to apologize too. I am sorry, Yukito-kun, and uh...

71
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm Kamio, Kamio Misuzu.

72
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,460
Oh, yes. I've seen you around, but...

73
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,060
I don't leave a very strong impression on people.

74
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,570
She and I know each other. She's come here for examinations a few times

75
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,700
Anyway, your birthday turned out weird in the end.

76
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,850
Yeah, but I get the feeling it will get even more memorable.

77
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,870
Why don't you become friends with Kano, instead of spending all this time with me?

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
You might get along pretty well.

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,390
You are both a little different...

80
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,500
Yeah, I guess you're right.

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,590
What's the matter?

82
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,560
I forgot to get paid for today.

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,650
You go ahead and go on home.

84
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,160
Can't you wait till tomorrow?

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,340
They may screw it up if I wait till tomorrow.

86
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,240
Hey, where is my pa-

87
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,330
Gone to sleep already?

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,440
This place isn't secure at all.

89
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,020
Jeez! I asked you not to turn on the light so suddenly!

90
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,420
Oh, sorry, but without light, I can't examine you well.

91
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,350
Oh, you've grown so much.

92
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,600
Stop it, Big Sis!

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,610
Don't touch me there!

94
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,130
It's called palpation and is a legitimate medical examination.

95
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,190
Palpation isn't the same as massaging.

96
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,880
Did you hear that?

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,930
What?

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,480
Oh, it's a cat.

99
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,660
But we don't have a cat here.

100
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,890
Oh yeah. Then I guess it was just my imagination.

101
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,300
Yes, it must've been.

102
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,970
Then, Kano, let's continue.

103
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,960
Kano?

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,730
Hey, What's going on? Kano?

105
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,420
I see, you're back again.

106
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,410
It's been a while.

107
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,690
Again? Stop it already!

108
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,350
Always saying the same words...

109
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,680
This child is my life! My only treasure!

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,130
No! Kano is mine!

111
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,080
My precious little sister!

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,850
What?

113
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,690
What, what, what?

114
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,780
Why are you hugging me, Big Sis?

115
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,480
You were half asleep.

116
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,640
You started to hug me, so I embraced you in return.

117
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,460
I don't remember that at all.

118
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,510
That's why I've been telling you to go to bed earlier.

119
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,420
Yeah, but can we stay like this just a little while longer?

120
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,740
You held me like this when Dad passed away.

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,980
Yeah, that's right.

122
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,620
Big Sis, you smell good.

123
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,430
Oh! A cicada flew in through the vent again!

124
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,460
Oh! The soy sauce bottle fell over!

125
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,570
Oh! The salad oil spilled!

126
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,910
Oh! Yukito-san's bacon and eggs just had a horrible accident!

127
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,690
Hey, Misuzu!

128
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,680
I won!

129
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,060
Yukito-san?

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,140
Is something wrong?

131
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,020
Something happened to this, didn't it?

132
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,110
Nothing, nothing.

133
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,360
Why are you looking at me like that, as though you're shocked that I'm actually eating it.

134
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,770
I'm not looking like that. No, no.

135
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,210
Yukito-san, is it good?

136
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,020
Yeah.

137
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,970
Really?

138
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,770
Yeah.

139
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,790
It doesn't taste like cicada?

140
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,100
What do you mean by that?!

141
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,670
Nothing, nothing.

142
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,350
Yukito-san?

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,650
We're here.

144
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,860
Oh, sorry.

145
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,540
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,320
Kind of.

147
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,490
Is it about last night?

148
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,500
Well, this and that.

149
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,250
See you later, then!

150
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,760
Okay.

151
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,220
G-gao!

152
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,900
Hey.

153
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,880
At least do enough to earn your wages.

154
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,620
I've done everything.

155
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,200
Then, I have more. Come over here.

156
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,230
Why are you looking at me like that?

157
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,840
If you want to say something, say it.

158
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,260
A pay raise is out of the question, by the way.

159
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,500
It's nothing like that.

160
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,880
Then, what is it?

161
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,000
Actually, it's about last night-

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
- Hey...
Actually, it's about last night-

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,900
Have you seen Potato?

164
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,730
Potato?

165
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,310
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him.

166
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,900
Yeah, I've been looking for him, but I can't find him!

167
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,760
Potato!

168
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,870
Potato!

169
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,650
Potato, come on out!

170
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,950
Potato!

171
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,380
Potato!

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,500
I wonder where Potato went off to?

173
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,230
It's almost sunset.

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,320
What's wrong?

175
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,470
No, nothing. Let's keep looking.

176
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,020
I guess he's not here either

177
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,170
I can't think of anywhere else to look.

178
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,290
Can't you use your magic to find him?

179
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,320
What?!

180
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,370
I don't think my magic works like that.

181
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,120
Is that so?

182
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,980
When I was given this bandana,

183
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,090
I was told to keep it on until I'm grown, and not to ever take it off till then.

184
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,980
Then I'll grow up to be able to use my magic.

185
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,370
Who gave it to you?

186
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,360
I was so little, I don't remember,

187
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,090
but I've been wearing it ever since.

188
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,650
It was really difficult at times like swim meets and health checks,

189
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,260
and I was teased sometimes too.

190
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,100
I see.

191
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,940
But you see, Big Sis always saved me!

192
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,720
That's how I was able to make it this far.

193
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,620
We've come all the way to school.

194
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,080
I don't think he could possibly be here...

195
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,280
Huh? What is it? Wait up!

196
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
Hey, Yukito-kun, what's going on all of the sudden?

197
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,820
I know where Potato is.

198
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,520
Really?

199
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,390
He is right over there.

200
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,030
Right over there? You mean at school?

201
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,370
Yeah, he should be in here.

202
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,610
What? In this bush?

203
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,620
Are you sure?

204
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,450
Potato!

205
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,740
We finally found you!

206
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,570
Jeez, don't frighten me like this.

207
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,930
But what are you doing here?

208
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,270
And Yukito-kun, how did you know that he was here?

209
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,070
That is... well... uh...

210
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,570
Well, it's like a sort of magic.

211
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:36,750
Right?!

212
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,350
Now listen, Potato.

213
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,470
Don't ever wander off without telling me, okay?

214
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,400
If only your actions lived up to your response.

215
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,180
But what a relief!

216
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,350
Kano.

217
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,390
Yes?

218
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,710
You really don't remember anything about last night?

219
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,880
No. I'm sorry, really...

220
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,730
No. Don't worry about it.

221
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,030
Yukito-kun. Would you listen to something?

222
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,490
Yeah, you can tell me anything.

223
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,330
I remember almost nothing about my mother.

224
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,700
I've been told that she was never very healthy.

225
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,330
She fell ill right after she gave birth to me.

226
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,870
And she passed away when I was about three.

227
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,940
Dad told me that Mom was a lot like me.

228
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,100
But I have a hard time picturing that.

229
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,710
Oh, but, but, I wasn't that lonely.

230
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,480
Big Sis was like a Mom, and I had Dad.

231
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,060
But Big Sis didn't have a Mom that whole time.

232
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,660
I realized recently how unfair that was.

233
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,310
Dad was always busy with his clinic, and then he got sick himself.

234
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,860
The only thing I could do was to watch.

235
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,630
Even now, Big Sis works and takes care of me,

236
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,980
but I can't really help.

237
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm not of much help either.

238
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,690
That's not true, not at all!

239
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,310
If... if I can ever use my magic,

240
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,040
I... would like to see Mom.

241
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,450
I want to apologize to her in person, for many things.

242
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,210
Rather than apologizing, you should thank her.

243
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,420
You are here because of her.

244
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,000
If someone said to me, "I'm sorry that you gave birth to me,"

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,770
I would be furious.

246
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,680
Oh, I see.

247
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,210
I guess so!

248
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,270
What is your Mom like?

249
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,090
She's not here either.

250
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,260
A long time ago, she went to the same place your Mom is.

251
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,770
I see.

252
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,810
My mother was looking for a girl in the sky.

253
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,090
A girl?

254
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah. "Beyond this sky, there is a girl with wings."

255
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,590
She used to say that a lot.

256
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,380
I'm looking for the girl, too.

257
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,690
Then when I can fly someday, I'll look for her.

258
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,350
I'm home.

259
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,230
You're sure late.

260
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,390
Are you alone?

261
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,570
She's in her room.

262
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,830
She's not feeling too good, so she's in bed.

263
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,720
Don't you have to be there for her?

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,450
If I'm there, she won't rest well.

265
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,410
You're her mother. It shouldn't bother her.

266
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,090
We may be mother and daughter, but we do have issues.

267
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,840
Misuzu, I'm coming in.

268
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,350
Oh, Yukito-san.

269
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,100
You're not feeling well?

270
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,840
No, but it's not that bad.

271
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,500
Sorry, I couldn't go get you today.

272
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,130
Don't worry. You're busy, too.

273
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,170
Well, okay...

274
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,270
But you must really like dinosaurs.

275
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,700
Why does she like dinosaurs so much?

276
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,570
Who knows? She's always liked them, ever since she was a little girl.

277
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,170
You don't know your daughter very well, do you?

278
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,140
Didn't you forget that it was her birthday yesterday?

279
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,410
Hey, is there anything weird about her during the day?

280
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,810
She's always a little weird, isn't she?

281
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,330
That's not what I mean.

282
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,090
Oh, if there's nothing, it's all right.

283
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,630
What are you talking about?

284
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,650
Enough with the gloomy talk!

285
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,080
Let's get started on the main event of the day.

286
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,480
An erotic confessions corner!

287
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
- So we're doing that after all?!
An erotic confessions corner!

288
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,860
Oh, no, no. Just saying the title turns me on!

289
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,660
- What are you, a nymphomaniac?
Oh, no, no. Just saying the title turns me on!

290
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,030
- What are you, a nymphomaniac?

291
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,770
Romantic?

292
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, romantic.

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,260
Because, dinosaurs thrived for eons, but they went extinct.

294
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,880
They came to an end.

295
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,990
Somehow, that tears me up and makes me emotional.

296
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,100
Are you still having the dreams?

297
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,120
Yeah, I still do.

298
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,970
I'm traveling backwards through my dreams.

299
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,490
What do you mean by that?

300
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,220
I can't explain it well, but I can tell...

301
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,040
The scent of the breeze and its sensation on my skin...

302
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,720
The way the air flows and the seasons change...

303
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,640
They all show me that I'm going back in time.

304
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,070
I've never heard of dreams like that.

305
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,400
Yukito-san.

306
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,870
Where do you think my dreams are taking me?

307
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,670
Okay, are you ready?

308
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,870
Potato, don't you get hit by mistake.

309
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,720
So it's watermelon splitting today, huh?

310
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,100
Yeah, Kano wanted to do it.

311
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,310
Don't you think you're spoiling her a little?

312
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,790
Here I go!

313
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,670
See you tomorrow!

314
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,300
It's deserted.

315
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,950
It'll be impossible to make money here-

316
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,390
Kunisaki Yukito!

317
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,590
Yukito-san!

318
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,120
Don't crash into me every single time!

319
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,860
Why didn't you come yesterday?

320
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,630
Yesterday?

321
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,100
We were waiting for you... Minagi missed you.

322
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,670
I didn't mind

323
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,330
You're putting up a strong front again!

324
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,060
I'm sorry. I got too busy yesterday.

325
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,110
To make up for it, you will live here starting today!

326
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,850
Don't be silly.

327
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,470
You wanted me to leave the town to start with anyway.

328
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,680
That has nothing to do with this!

329
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,710
Wow! He got up!

330
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,100
I can't figure it out.

331
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,140
Looks like I win.

332
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,340
It's really a wonder.

333
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,720
You have such a wonderful talent, Kunisaki-san.

334
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,590
I applaud you.

335
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,340
I have just a touch of telekinetic ability.

336
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,360
Telekinetic ability...

337
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
There are so many wonders in this world...

338
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,130
I have a special thank you gift for you.

339
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,360
Ta-da!

340
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,850
Kunisaki-san?

341
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,080
A girl with wings?

342
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,040
Yeah, I'm looking for the same girl my mother was trying to find.

343
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,660
Do you think I'm silly?

344
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,840
I had a picture book like that when I was a little girl.

345
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,250
A picture book?

346
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,230
In that book, there was a girl with pure white wings on her back.

347
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,510
As a little girl,

348
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,140
I dreamt of flying through the sky with her one day.

349
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,740
It's not silly at all,

350
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,510
even if you're journeying in search of that girl.

351
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,730
Because surely everyone has somewhere they want to reach.

352
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,050
I can tell the stars are going to be beautiful again tonight.

353
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,050
Minagi!

354
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,550
Help me out! I can't do it right at all!

355
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,410
I'm coming, Michiru.

356
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,410
Somewhere I want to reach?

357
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm done with today's homework!

358
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,930
Yukito-san!

359
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,890
Let's play cards. Cards.

360
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,430
Why, all of a sudden?

361
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,760
I've always wanted to play cards with you.

362
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,290
Play by yourself.

363
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,300
We have come from a faraway planet-

364
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,560
I wanna play cards.

365
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,990
I wanna play cards!

366
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,310
I wanna play cards!

367
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,300
I wanna play cards-

368
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,070
Misuzu! Are you here?

369
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,040
Kano disappeared again. Is she here?

370
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,850
How about the shrine?

371
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,520
I've already looked there. I'll try the school.

372
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,940
Can you two go that way?

373
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,560
Yeah.

374
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,710
Yukito-san, do you have any idea?

375
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,110
We just have to look anywhere we can think of.

376
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,090
Kano!

377
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,460
- Kirishima-san!
Kano!

378
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,450
- Kirishima-san!

379
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,980
Potato?

380
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,270
I think he's telling us to follow him.

381
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,930
The shrine again?

382
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,080
But she said she'd already looked there.

383
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,040
Kano!

384
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,000
Hey, are you all right?

385
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,940
Sacrifice her... My only treasure...

386
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,500
Kano!

387
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,340
Then I would rather... with my own hands...

388
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,800
Hey, Kano!

389
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,530
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

390
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:26,890
Catching hold of the scrap of a dream that fades to white
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

391
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,210

392
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,210
Shounen wa hashiru

393
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,780
The young boy runs
Shounen wa hashiru

394
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,420
The young boy runs

395
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:32,880
Te wo hanashitara dokomademo tooku kaze no ne ni kieteyuku

396
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:47,000
When he lets go, it goes on forever, vanishing into the cry of the wind
Te wo hanashitara dokomademo tooku kaze no ne ni kieteyuku

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,520
When he lets go, it goes on forever, vanishing into the cry of the wind

398
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:47,650
Itsuka mieta yasashisa wa mou nai

399
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:55,090
The kindness I could once see is now gone
Itsuka mieta yasashisa wa mou nai

400
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,580
The kindness I could once see is now gone

401
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,820
Hitori fumidasu ashidake miteru
The kindness I could once see is now gone

402
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:06,390
All I see now are the steps my feet take

Asa ni wa kieta ano utagoe wo itsumademo kiiteta
All I see now are the steps my feet take

405
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:21,360
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning
Asa ni wa kieta ano utagoe wo itsumademo kiiteta

406
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,720
I listened forever to the singer's voice that had disappeared by morning

409
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:37,000
Always following the footprints we left behind

00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,910
She said she wanted to see the ocean.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,650
But I couldn't take her.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,750
There were so many things I wanted to do for her.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,790
But I couldn't do anything for her.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,160
Even though the summer had just begun...

6
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,120
Yukito-san.

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,160
Yukito-san, it's morning.

8
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,580
Yeah...

9
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,330
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:03,450
Kieru hikoukigumo bokutachi wa miokutta
We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

11

We watched as the vapor trails disappeared

12
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,080
We ran away because it was so bright

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:17,860

There are still unreachable places in the distance

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,540

The children walk along the summer railways

Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

Holding in both hands their wishes to take flight

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,500
We've been chasing and chasing after the disappearing vapor trails

episode five

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm glad that Kirishima-san got better.

48
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,260
Yeah.

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,820
I felt strange too, when I saw the plume.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,480
Yukito-san.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,900
What? Did you say something?

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,670
You've been spaced out ever since you got up this morning.

53
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,920
Yeah, well, I had a dream of when I was a kid.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,860
A dream?

55
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,370
It's no big deal.

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,680
More importantly, what about you? Are you still having those dreams?

57
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,870
Yes.

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,560
Last night's dream was completely different from the ones I had before.

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,500
The moon was in the sky, and it was very bright.

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,600
I was trying to fly up to the sky.

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,040
I was sore all over, but I kept going higher and higher...

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,500
Then, I heard voices.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,240
Voices?

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,950
I heard many people's voices. They were trying to confine me.

65
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,940
The noise became a whirr in my ears and I couldn't go on anymore.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Okay, I'll see you later.

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,520
Yeah.

68
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,870
I'll be going.

69
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,530

72
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,860
I wonder how he walks without strings.

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,650
Oh? He fell down.

74
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,770
He got up!

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,150
That's the way kids should be.

76
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,760
But you...

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Shouldn't you be with Kano?

78
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,840
Oh, she went to school to take care of the animals?

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:17,850
Wait, why are we having a normal conversation?
Oh, she went to school to take care of the animals?

81
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,430
Well, we should go now.

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,110
Okay.

83
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,360
Mr. Puppet, see you later.

84
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,820
Shake hands, shake hands!

85
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,780
Let's go.

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,950
That's what you call being "really close."

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,510
I didn't make any money again.

88
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,980
I wonder what's taking Misuzu so long.

89
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,310
Tohno.

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,180
Oh, Kunisaki-san. Good afternoon.

91
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,170
If you are going to talk, swallow first.

92
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,010
Thank you for lunch.

93
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,620
You are welcome.

94
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,040
Have you seen Misuzu?

95
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,700
Kamio-san? No.

96
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,350
I see.

97
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,620
Hey, will you make me hamburger again tomorrow?

98
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,280
Okay.

99
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,480
Yay!

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,220
What a little pig!

101
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,770
Let go!

102
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,870
You let go first!

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,230
Ouch, ouch...

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,650
Michiru?

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,340
Did the shower work all right?

106
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,310
Yeah. Why do you have the key to this place though?

107
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,270
My father was the stationmaster here.

108
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,080
He is no longer working here, though.

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,490
Is he working somewhere else?

110
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,140
I know what, I'll give you this as an apology.

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,590
And I will give you this too today.

112
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,170
Hey, it's the vial I found yesterday!

113
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,830
These are grains of star sand.

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,150
They are sand grains shaped like baby stars...

115
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,300
Wow, that's cool!

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,970
Here.

117
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,480
Wow!

118
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,730
They're smooth!

119
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,520
Kunisaki-san, here's one for you as well.

120
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,030
For me, too?

121
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,550
Yes. This way, the three of us match.

122
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:15,610
This sand was given to me by my father, when I was a little girl.

123
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,890
Then it means a lot to you, doesn't it?

124
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,570
Are you sure about this?

125
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,640
Yes. For you and Michiru, it's okay.

126
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,830
Looks like Kamio-san has already left.

127
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,190
I see.

128
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,090
I wonder if she stayed for a while after school?

129
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,150
Maybe...

130
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,320
Oh, do you have any plans after this, Kunisaki-san?

131
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,040
Welcome to the Astronomy Club.

132
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,060
Wow! The stars are already out!

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,310
Where are the other club members?

134
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,920
There are no other club members.

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,380
I am the only member.

136
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,460
You're the only one?

137
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,110
That's why I am the club president.

138
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,780
It's a very select group...

139
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,500
I see.

140
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Does she come here a lot?

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,290
No. This is the first time I've brought her here.

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,600
Umm, I didn't inconvenience you by inviting you here, did I?

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,370
No.

144
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,460
Is that so?

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,730
I wanted the three of us to observe the night sky tonight.

146
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,100
Because she seems to like you, Kunisaki-san.

147
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,070
I don't think that's possible.

148
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,960
It's true. All she talks about when she is with me is you.

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,840
She really loves you.

150
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,710
I can't believe that at all.

151
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,680
I can tell,

152
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,370
because she is my other half.

153
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,310
Other half?

154
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:13,860
Michiru and I have spent all of our time together like this.

155
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,350
She is so precious... Blush.

156
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,990
What about you, Kunisaki-san?

157
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,660
Me?

158
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,130
You have been traveling alone for a long time, haven't you?

159
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,920
Have you ever spent time like this?

160
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,260
The happiness of sharing time with someone else...

161
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,820
The joy of living for someone else's sake...

162
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,050
I'm sure I have.

163
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,320
Though it was long, long ago.

164
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,720
So long! I have to go now!

165
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,610
Okay, see you tomorrow.

166
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,910
Okay, okay! Michiru-dash!

167
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,160
Thank you for going through the trouble of walking me home.

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,850
Not at all.

169
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,100
You're pretty tall.

170
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,530
Do you not like tall women?

171
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,760
Oh, no. A good figure is an advantage.

172
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:13,860
Blush.

173
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,590
To tell you the truth, I am rather proud of it myself.

174
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,200
You are, rather, huh?

175
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,430
Yes, rather...

176
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,820
I figure the taller you are, the closer you are to the sky.

177
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,810
Thank you for walking me home.

178
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,220
Don't mention it.

179
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,360
Please be careful on your way home then.

180
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,670
Yeah.

181
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,830
Welcome home.

182
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,150
Oh, whom are you with?

183
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,350
A new astronomy club member.

184
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,120
Am I?

185
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,780
Oh, I remember you.

186
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,130
Thank you for the other day.

187
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,150
What?

188
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,840
I told you, didn't I? I helped her with some heavy stuff.

189
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,770
Thank you for walking my daughter home.

190
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,650
Now come on inside...

191
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,360
Michiru.

192
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,500
What's wrong, Michiru? Dinner is ready.

193
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,370
Yes.

194
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,100
Hey, Tohno...

195
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,740
Good-bye.
Hey, Tohno...

196
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,460
Good-bye.

197
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,350
I'm home.

198
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,130
Misuzu, I'm coming in.

199
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,150
Hey, wake up. You'll catch a cold.

200
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,480
Oh, Yukito-san. Good morning.

201
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,060
It's still night.

202
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,410
Why didn't you tell me you had to stay late?

203
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,740
Sorry. I forgot.

204
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,150
Good grief... Huh?

205
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,910
Are you keeping a picture diary?

206
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,410
Yeah. It was a summer assignment option.

207
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,740
<i>M-maestro! Why did you betray me?</i>

208
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,980
<i>You fool!</i>

209
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,750
<i>You think you can conduct this orchestra?!</i>

210
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,150
<i>That's a laugh!</i>

211
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,610
<i>Never
't conduct, who will?</i>

212
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,760
<i>Give the baton to me!</i>

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,910
<i>The only way you'll get it is over my dead body!</i>

214
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>Damn it!</i>

215
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,160
<i>Appas
.. God... Fingers-</i>

216
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,690
<i>Appassionato... God... Fingers-</i>

217
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,700
Hey, that was the best part!

218
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,540
Let's play cards.

219
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,740
You never give up, do you?

220
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,880
I just want to play cards with you.

221
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,680
You mean it?

222
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,030
Yeah. I mean it.

223
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,930
No matter what?

224
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,620
Yeah, no matter what.

225
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,890
Okay, I will play cards with you.

226
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,540
Yay!

227
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,510
Okay, what do you wanna play? Old Maid? Poker?

228
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,430
Make it an easy, mindless one.

229
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,840
Okay then, let's play "Concentration."

230
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,410
Oh!

231
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,860
Huh? What's wrong?

232
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,780
Oh, nothing...

233
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,570
I messed up.

234
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,570
Are you crying?

235
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,020
No, I'm not crying.

236
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I can play.

237
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,330
I have to try.

238
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,440
I have to try.

239
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,790
What's going on? Do you feel sick or something?

240
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,340
I'm okay! I'm okay!

241
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,740
Misuzu! What's going on? Hey!

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,300
Get a hold of yourself!

243
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,040
Misuzu...

244
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,010
All of a sudden, Misuzu...

245
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,030
I know.

246
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,310
Do you mind leaving for a moment?

247
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,840
Misuzu... Settle down, Misuzu!

248
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,970
She's been like that ever since she was a little girl.

249
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,780
It happens whenever it seems like she's about to make a friend.

250
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,990
When she's about to make a friend?

251
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,330
I took her to a clinic, even to a big hospital,

252
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,330
but it was no use.

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,850
They all say it's only in her head and she'll grow out of it.

254
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,480
To tell you the truth, she had an episode at school today.

255
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,170
They called me at work,

256
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,270
so I went to get her on my motorcycle, and brought her straight home.

257
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,190
I see.

258
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,430
I thought she might be all right with you. I was so hopeful...

259
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,730
She's all right when she's with me.

260
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,320
Are you really leaving?

261
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,540
Misuzu suffers attacks when I'm here, right?

262
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,390
I should keep my distance for a little while.

263
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,540
Okay, I see.

264
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,160
Tell her that I'll still keep walking her to and from school.

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,820
Come over for dinner every now and then.

266
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,820
It's my fault that you had to move out.

267
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,010
Aren't you lonely by yourself?

268
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,540
Even though I'm living alone, I've made quite a few friends somehow.

269
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,940
You have friends too, don't you?

270
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,450
Oh, no. I don't have any friends. I've always been alone.

271
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:26,130
I start crying whenever I'm about to make a friend, so everyone stays away.

272
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,710
But you have Haruko. You're not alone.

273
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,140
My mom, well, she's not my real mom.

274
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,500
Really?

275
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,790
Haruko-san is actually my aunt.

276
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,740
She had to take me in because I'm so strange.

277
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,900
She didn't want me, but I ended up living here.

278
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,530
But, I don't want to be any trouble,

279
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,200
so we live our separate lives under the same roof.

280
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,110
That's why I don't ask for much.

281
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm a real burden on her, and I don't want to cause any more trouble.

282
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,710
So, I have fun by myself, finding weird juices or playing cards.

283
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,720
Misuzu.

284
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,970
Just keep smiling.

285
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,400
V!

286
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,510
See you later then.

287
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,440
Be careful.

288
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,580
What's wrong?

289
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,180
Minagi hasn't come.

290
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,150
She's at school. She'll be here soon.

291
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,420
It's not her day to go to school.

292
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,520
Maybe I did something wrong.

293
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,750
Let me see that.

294
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,700
Give it back!

295
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,020
Just watch.

296
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,390
Stop! It's an indirect kiss! How dirty! Oh, no!
Just watch.

297
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,050
Stop! It's an indirect kiss! How dirty! Oh, no!

298
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,100
Don't be precocious.
Stop! It's an indirect kiss! How dirty! Oh, no!

299
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,000
Wow!

300
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,280
Cool! Do it again!

301
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,030
Wow! Wow!

302
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,540
Bubbles are so pretty.

303
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,630
They're empty and just like the sky.

304
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,590
She didn't come.

305
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,790
No, she didn't.

306
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,540
I wonder if something happened.

307
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,170
Why don't we go to her house then?

308
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,720
Go to Minagi's house?

309
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,660
Yeah. If she doesn't come, then you should go visit her.

310
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,150
What's wrong?

311
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,730
I don't want to go to her house.

312
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,670
Aren't you her friend? You've never been to her house?

313
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,400
Then, I'll go alone. I have to go pick up Misuzu, too.

314
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,270
Thank you for walking me home.

315
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,570
Sorry but I have to run today.

316
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,070
You're not going to have dinner with us?

317
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,460
I have to go somewhere. See you tomorrow.

318
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,150
Who are you?

319
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,760
I met you last night. I'm the new member of the astronomy club.

320
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,400
Yes?

321
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,140
May I see your daughter? I need to talk to her.

322
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,390
My daughter?

323
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,160
Isn't she at home?

324
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,480
I don't have a daughter.

325
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,140
What?

326
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,480
Maybe you have the wrong address.

327
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,180
Hey, are you kidding me? Hey!

328
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,160
What are you doing here, skipping work?

329
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,160
Tohno's mother has been suffering from a psychological disorder.

330
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,980
I've been checking on her every time I get a chance.

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,960
She believed that her older daughter, Minagi, was her second daughter, the one who died.

332
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,790
She's believed that for a long time.

333
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,770
But it seems her condition suddenly changed.

334
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,920
When she accepted the fact that her second daughter was dead,

335
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,100
she erased Minagi-san from her mind as well.

336
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,160
In her mind, she never had either one of her daughters.

337
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,150
I was supposed to have a little sister, named Michiru.

338
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,020
A precious little sister.

339
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,070
I was a daddy's girl, so Mother was lonely.

340
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,480
The baby she was expecting was supposed to fill her void.

341
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,080
If you could have just one dream come true, what would it be?

342
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,300
Umm... Ummm...

343
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,110
I want a little sister!

344
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,480
Mother's hopes lost their destination, so she chose to live in her dreams.

345
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,580
And I became a fragment of that dream.

346
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,800
But last night, she dreamt about the time she miscarried Michiru.

347
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,760
According to Kirishima-sensei, that made her accept reality.

348
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:31,040
This morning, my mother looked at me and said, "Who are you?"

349
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,120
She can't go back?

350
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,490
This is the end of my dream.

351
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,070
My own dream of a life as Michiru has ended.

352
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,610
My wings have forgotten how to fly.

353
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:58,390
For I have only been pretending to flap them.

354
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,950
Is there a purpose to wings that cannot fly?

355
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:18,940
Shiroku togireta yume no kirehashi wo tsukamaete

356

All I see now are the steps my feet take

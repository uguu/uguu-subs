SIGN: If you do that
 
If you do that...
 
...that wouldn't be fair to Rin-chan.
 
Hey.
 
You.
 
I can introduce you to someone to marry.
 
They all want to marry a Japanese person.
 
Choose whoever you want!
 
They don't mind if it's only on paper.
 
That fits perfectly with my intentions.
 
Hey!
 
But if you marry into one of their families...
 
...you'll become a citizen of their country, right?
 
I'm not really sure though.
 
SIGN: New Citizenship
 
You can have an old name...
 
...without marrying into a different family.
 
Actually, you already have an old name!
 
Your old name was...
 
Belozerov the 6th!
 
A penniless poet in 17th century Saint Petersburg!
 
What did you say!?
 
I'm sorry!
 
I couldn't hear you because of all the noise in the background!
 
A penniless poet in 17th century Saint Petersburg!
 
Wouldn't that be my past life's name...
 
...instead of my old name!?
 
Your current name becomes your old name in your next life.

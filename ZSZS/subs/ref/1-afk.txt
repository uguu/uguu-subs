Me?
Yes.
You.
Comrade Nozomu Itoshiki.
Comrade?
You haven't been to any meetings recently.
And you haven't been in touch.
What's been going on?
Meetings?
What do you mean?
Isn't that obvious?
The HAMASHO meeting.
The revolutionary religious order...
HAMASHO.
Religious order HAMASHO.

HAMASHO

Yes.
You should know of it.
For you were one of the leaders.
One of the leaders?
Me?
I know nothing about that!
Nothing at all!
Besides, what does HAMASHO mean?
Is it short for Shoko Hamada?
Or Shogo Hamada?
Neither.
A religious order which worships at the beach while covered in piss...
[HAMABE : beach ; SHOBEN : piss]
...abbreviated as...
...HAMASHO.

How could such a bizarre religion exist!?
Wh-What did you say!?
You just called us a bizarre religion, didn't you!?

SHOCK

The followers of the revolutionary religious order @HAMASHO were hidden all around the city
Nozomu was pursued as a traitor by an order he had never joined

What an ordeal...

Gérard

This should be far enough...

Palm Reading

No way!

Nideal Umbrellas

I was never a believer!
So I can't be a traitor!
You've got it wrong!
You have the wrong person!
This defies logic!
How can people be so unreasonable!?

I'm in despair!
This irrational world has left me in despair!

What?
Nozomu Itoshiki escaped?
Use any means necessary!
Capture him!
Sieg HAMASHO!

Nozomu, still being chased, found a boat and took it to sea

If I use this...

But the boat was actually a trap placed by the leader resembling DeOOin Zabi
The island Nozomu arrived at was HAMASHO's base

What is this place!?

I know your weaknesses!

Women and lotus roots!

Aware of Nozomu's weaknesses, the leader sent a swarm of women with one meter busts

Nozomu is in grave danger

Moral
Wh-What is this!?
We finally meet, Nozomu-kun.
We will be modifying your traitorous body.
Into a loyal soldier of HAMASHO.
Modifying humans...
What are you talking about!?
That's just unrealistic...
They're real!
Come.
Let's begin!
I beg you.
If you're going to modify me...
...at least turn me into a grasshopper man!
Or a beetle man!
Or one of those Imagin freaks!
Understood.
I'll turn you into a bizarre mole cricket man!

After being turned into a mole cricket man, Nozomu escapes the base before he can be brainwashed

I'm in despair!
Being turned into a mole cricket man has left me in despair!
I'm already paid next to nothing!
Now, I'm a mole cricket!
Damn it!
I'll go die!
No, wait.
If I'm going to live such a worthless life...
...I might be happier if I let them brainwash me.

Nozomu decided to return to the base to be brainwashed, but it was already too late
HAMASHO's mutant brigade has already come in pursuit

Wh-What do I do!?

Cornered by the mutant brigade, Nozomu decided to jump
His body plunged into the night sea
Nozomu's ordeal continued
He was captured by pirates and tortured

Save me!

Fought with sea monsters
Wracked by hunger and thirst
Barely alive, he finally reached the AshiOOOO Cape School for Girls
AshiOOOO Cape is a famous place in OOOOO

I was so surprised to find him sleeping there.
You came from Tokyo, right?
Thought so.
I was worried.
Since you were taking so long to take over.
Take over?
What do you mean?
This is your new teacher.
Teacher?

Teacher?
Before he knew what was going on, Nozomu Itoshiki had become a teacher at a school for girls
The first class

It's a pleasure to meet you.
I will be your new teacher, Nozomu Itoshiki.
Yes!
May I call you Left-wing Guerilla from now on?

Left-wing Guerilla

Left-wing Guerilla?
What's that?
I just felt that you looked left-wing and guerilla-like.
I see.
He does have a left-wing guerilla vibe.
Mr. Left-wing Guerilla!
Nice to meet you!

I'm in despair.
Being given a meaningless nickname has left me in despair.
I'll die this time.
Teacher.
If you're going to die...
...you might as well do someone a favor.
A favor?
A fake wedding.

Fake wedding

We need you to marry a girl from the Holy Nosebleed Empire.
Fake wedding?
Nosebleed?
She's the one.

I am a very poor, little truant.

However,
I'm willingly going to school today.

Of course, I have a reason
I have a reason
Nobody feels sorry for me.
Poor thing
Why didn't anyone get worried and come to my house?

R-Really.
I'm sorry.
I'm not this class's teacher.
Then what is our teacher doing?
Um, well...
He's been truant since last week.
The teacher's truant?
It's not so unusual these days.
A truant teacher is worse than a truant student.
I wonder if he's okay.
Doesn't it make you worry?

Are you okay?
Worried
Worried
Worried

They're worrying about him instead of me!

Heh...
Oh, well...
They'll have no choice but to worry about me once they see this.

Ah.

Are you okay?

Yes!

Fuzzy logic is derived from fuzzy set theory
dealing with reasoning that is approximate
rather than precisely deduced from classical predicate logic.
It can be thought of as the application side of fuzzy set theory
dealing with well thought out real world expert values
for a complex problem (Klir 1997).
Degrees of truth are often confused with probabilities.
However, they are distinct conceptually;
fuzzy truth represents membership in vaguely defined sets,
not likelihood of some event or condition.
For example, if a 100-ml glass contains 30 ml of water,
then, for two fuzzy sets, Empty and Full,
one might define the glass as being 0.7 empty and 0.3 full.
Note that the concept of emptiness would be subjective
and thus would depend on the observer or designer.
Another designed might equally well design a set membership function
where the glass would be considered full for all values down to 50 ml.
A probabilistic setting would first define a scalar variable
for the fullness of the glass,
and second, conditional distributions describing the probability
that someone would call the glass full
given a specific fullness level.
Note that the conditioning can be achieved
by having a specific observer
that randomly selects the label for the glass,
a distribution over deterministic observers, or both.
While fuzzy logic avoids talking about randomness
in this context, this simplification at the same time
obscures what is exactly meant
by the statement the 'glass is 0.3 full'.

The relationship of symmetry to aesthetics is complex.
Certain simple symmetries, and in particular bilateral symmetry,
seem to be deeply ingrained in the inherent perception
by humans of the likely health or fitness of other living creatures,
as can be seen by the simple experiment
of distorting one side of the image
of an attractive face and asking viewers to rate
the attractiveness of the resulting image.
Consequently, such symmetries that mimic biology
tend to have an innate appeal that in turn drives a powerful tendency
to create artifacts with similar symmetry.
One only needs to imagine the difficulty in trying
to market a highly asymmetrical car or truck
to general automotive buyers to understand
the power of biologically inspired symmetries
such as bilateral symmetry.

An ordinary truant lacks impact.
Besides, if you're a truant...
...why are you here?
That would mean you're not a truant!
Either stop calling yourself a truant...
...or stop coming to school!
That really irritates me!
Make up your mind properly!

Illustration: Katsuya Terada

Nozomu Itoshiki
ito shiki nozomu -> zetsu bou

his name now reads as "zetsubou,"
which translates into despair.

Kagerou Usui
usu i kage rou -> kage ga usu i

"Seki uttarou" translates to "I'll sell my name," which is what he did.

Kafuka Fuura
fuu ra ka fu ka

Kafuka Fuura is not her real name.

Meru Otonashi

ME-RU refers to e-mail and text messaging,
her primary means of communication.

Kaere/Kaede Kimura
ki mura KA E RE kaede -> kae re
Seat #21

Abiru Kobushi
ko bushi a bi ru -> kobushi (wo) a bi ru
Seat #22
After combining her name and adding a "wo,"
her name becomes "kobushi wo abiru," which means flurry of punches.

Seat #23
When komori and kiri are combined,
her name becomes komorikiri,
which refers to secluding yourself in your room.

Nami Hitou
hi tou na mi -> hito na mi
Seat #28
After combining her name and dropping the "u,"
her name becomes "hitonami,"
which means average, ordinary or normal.

Harumi Fujiyoshi
fuji yoshi haru mi -> fu jyo shi haru mi
Seat #29
After changing the "yo" to a small "yo,"

and "Harumi," which was a former site for ComiKet.

Mayo Mitama
mi tama ma yo -> mi ta ma ma yo
Seat #30
When her name is read together, it becomes mita mama yo,
which translates to "exactly the way she looks."

her name is read as niichie,
which is a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche.

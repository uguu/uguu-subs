Mr. Despair begins living according to his age after being threatened by Chiri-chan.
	
He wears a padded kimono and putters with his bonsai in the yard.

It'll look better if I cut this spot.

Snip. Snip.

Oh, looking good!

Gosh, my back hurts.

Isn't that a really stereotypical portrayal of a 57-year-old man?

57-years-olds act younger these days.

Teacher's being fifty-seven in his own way so it's okay.

I wonder how old Chiri-chan is.

What is that?

A program that determines your skin's age.

TEXT: Suzuki Shoten High School Student Assembly

Wait!

What is this?

Isn't it the name of our school?

TEXT: Suzuki Shoten High School

The name of our school was never mentioned before...

What's with this Suzuki Shoten High School!?

Naming rights.

In other words, the right to name a high school.

We're named after our sponsor.

This is the first time I've heard about it!

TEXT: Bellybutton lint

The name has been constantly changing...

It's not a big deal.

Don't be so casual about it!

TEXT: DOn't...

That's right...

I don't see some of the students that were in this class...

Like him.

Or him.

They passed.

Don't be so casual about it!

TEXT: I only react to Miku

You're going to use this opportunity to casually ignore randomly inconvenient plot settings!

It's pretty hard.

Like Inoue-san's a bit earlier...

We'll have to change the number of days between TV and DVD version.

Didn't you just casually reveal something?

In any case...

You will find that people casually reveal embarrassing information everywhere.

Please look at this.

In this world, a single piece of paper is used...

TEXT: Notice that your information has been leaked

...for an important message that...

TEXT (from top to bottom): Notice that your information has been leaked

Everyone talks casually!

Are you in despair!?

Are you in despair!?

Are you in despair, dear brother!?

That was a rude interruption, Rin!

If casual talk has left you in despair...

...why don't you do the opposite?

The opposite?

I see...

I'll say something utterly pointless...

...in a grandiose and overdramatic manner.

SIGN: 2 - H

That reminds me...

I...

...haven't eaten lunch today!

Lunch...!?

Hey!

Don't overdramatize something that doesn't matter!

I've decided to oppose society...

...and make worthless statements in a grandiose manner!

That sounds fun.

While we're at it...

I thought the elevator was going up...

...but it was going down!

TEXT: SHOCK

Down, you say!?

I bought a can of coffee.

But...

...it was warm!

What was that!?

What was that!?

What was that!?

So sorry! So sorry!

How could I make such a dramatic statement!?

Give it a try, Chiri.

It's fun.

How stupid.

But it looks kind of fun.

TEXT: Sorry
	-Abe-san
	
Yes...

That reminds me...

I injected juice into my sister once!

I overdramatized such a trifle of a matter.

That's a really big deal!

TOP TEXT: Garlic injections provide vitamins such as B1 and B2 as well as glucose.
		Vitamin B improves the recovery of energy, removes the lactic acid that causes fatigue, and produces energy which leads to high stamina.
BOTTOM TEXT: The injected Vitamin B1 contains sulfuric acid which emits a garlic-like odor, thus the name.
			Garlic injections are good. They just happen to be illegal.
			
What are you saying?

A really big deal would be compressed gas...

Don't say it!

TOP TEXT: Unneeded cans of compressed gas, abandoned, used cans of compressed gas, or cans of compressed gas that someone has used
		are frequently left lying around. Under the High Voltage Gas Security Act, leaving cans of compressed gas lying around is a criminal act.
BOTTOM TEXT: A government department is assigned control any matters in this area.

Wait!

She was a little sister!?

That's the real shocker!

RIGHT TEXT: Young Death Master

Young death master.

I inherited my desire to die from my parents...

...and spent most of my childhood plotting my death.

In grade school...

...I jumped from the second floor, but I didn't die.

The next year...

...I tried slitting my wrists with a paper knife...

...but I still didn't die.

The year after that...

...I tried hanging myself my twisting paper into a rope...

I tried gassing myself to death with chimichangas but I didn't die.

Such was my life.
